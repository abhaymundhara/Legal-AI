This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated \n10.03.2014, as passed by the High Court of Calcutta in W.P.L.R.T. No. 325 \nof 2013 whereby, the High Court has allowed the writ petition filed by the \nrespondent Nos. 1 and 2 of this appeal and has disapproved  the orders \ndated 27.01.2010 and 01.08.2012 as passed by the Controller, Calcutta \nThika  Tenancy1 as also the order dated 18.12.2013 as passed  by the West \nBengal Land Reforms and Tenancy Tribunal  at Calcutta2. \n1.1.  By the orders aforesaid, the Controller and the Tribunal had \nconcluded that the present appellants were thika tenants in respect of the \nproperty involved in this litigation and the landlord\u2019s interest therein stood \nvested in the State  under the statutes governing thika tenancies . However, \nin the impugned judgment and order dated 10.03.2014, the High Court  \nconcluded to the opposite  and held  that the Controller and the Tribunal \nwere not justified in accepting the present appellants as thika tenants in \nrespect of the property in question.  \n2. Put in a nutshell, the issues involved in this appeal revolve around \nthika tenancy enactments , as applicable to the property  and the tenancy in \nquestion. The nature of tenancy created in favour of the a ppellants  and/or \ntheir predecessors and impact /implication  of the structure put  up by them \non the property  in question form the core of the typical and peculiar \nquestions involved in this matter.  \n \n1 Hereinafter also referred to as \u2018the Controller\u2019.  \n2 Hereinafter also referred to as \u2018the Tribunal\u2019.  3 \n 3. Before proceeding further, we may point out that the consideration \nherein relates to thika tenancy and undoubtedly, the word \u2018 thika\u2019 in Bengali \nmeans \u2018temporary or partial\u20193. \nStatutory Provisions  \n4. Ordinarily, we would have commenced the  discussion with relevant \nfactual aspects  but, in the present case, even for proper appreciation of \nfactual matrix, an insight into the relevant provisions of law with reference \nto their enactment as also  chronology of their enforcement appears \nnecessary. Hence, before adverting to the facts of the ca se, we deem it \nappropriate to extract  the relevant statutory provisions relating to thika \ntenancy, in their feasible chronology and also with reference to the ir objects \nand reasons.  We shall deal with the construction of phraseology of these \nprovisions and  implications thereof a little later. For the present purpose, \nonly the relevant provisions are being reproduced.  \n5. In order to make better provisions  in respect of the  law of landlord \nand tenant as also  thika tenancy in Calcutta , the Calcutta Thika  Tenancy \nAct, 1949 (West Bengal Act II of 1949)4 came to be enacted  in place of its \npredecessor Ordinance and  with the following S tatement of Objects and \nReasons: - \n \n\u201cSTATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS  \nThere has been a persistent demand for legislative meas ures for \nthe protection of the thika  tenants of Calcutta and the Howrah \nMunicipal area against arbitrary eviction and enhancement of rent. \n \n3 Vide Sri Sri Satyanarayan & Ors. v. S.C. Chunder : (2001) 3 CHN 64 1- paragraph 19, \nreproducing from the decision in the case of  Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. Sashi \nBhusan Mondal , APD No. 280 of 1981 . \n4 Hereinafter also referred to as \u2018the Act of 1949\u2019.  4 \n Accordingly, an Ordinance was promulgated staying all decree or \norders for eviction of the thika  tenants on any groun d other than \nnon-payment of rent.  \nThe present Bill has been framed, with a view to regulate the \nrights and liabilities of the thika  tenants and their landlords.\u201d  \n5.1. The said enactment  made various provisions as regards the extent \nof thika tenancies , the grounds on which a thika tenan t could have been \nejected ; the procedure relating to the proceedings for ejectment; the \nregulation of  rent and its payment ; appeals and other special matte rs etc. \nAll other provisions of this enactment are not required to be dilated but , it \nis the definition of \u201cthika tenant \u201d occurring in clause (5) of Section 2 of the \nAct of 1949 , as substituted in the year 1953 , which  is of relevance and the \nsame may be re produced as under: - \n\u201c2. Definitions. - \n  ***   ***   *** \n(5) \"thika  tenant\" means any person who holds, whether under a \nwritten lease or otherwise, land under another person, and is or but \nfor a special contract would be liable to pay rent, at a monthly or any \nother periodical rate, for that land to that another person an d has \nerected or acquired by purchase or gift any structure on such land  \nfor a residential, manufacturing or business purpose and includes \nthe successors in interest of such person, but does not include a \nperson - \n(a) who holds such land under that another  person in perpetuity; \nor  \n(b) who holds such land under that another person under a \nregistered lease, in which the duration of the lease is expressly \nstated to be for a period of not less than twelve years; or  \n(c) who holds such land under that another pe rson and uses or \noccupies such land as a khattal .\u201d \n5.1.1. The nature of structure , if put up by the tenant over the demised \npremise s, has a bearing over the questions relating to thika  tenancy and \nhas its direct implication in the present case, as shall be noticed hereafter \nlater.   5 \n 5.2. By way of Amendment Act No. XXIX of 1969, clause (4a) was \ninserted to Section 2 and Section 10A was also inserted to the Act of 19 49. \nThese two provisions could also be reproduced as under: - \n\u201c2. Definitions. - \n  ***   ***   *** \n(4a) \" pucca structure \" means any structure constructed mainly of \nbrick, stone or concrete or any combination of these materials; \u201d \n  ***   ***   *** \n\u201c10A. Right of thika  tenant to erect pucca  structures. -(1) \nNotwithstanding anything containe d in any other law for the time \nbeing in force or in any contract, but subject to the provisions of sub -\nsections (2) and (3), a thika  tenant using the land comprised in his \nholding for a residential purpose may erect a pucca  structure on \nsuch land for such  purpose with the previous  permission of the \nController.  \n(2) On an application made by a thika  tenant in this behalf, the \nController may grant him permission to erect a pucca  structure, if \nthe Controller is  satisfied that the thika  tenant  - \n(a) is using the structure existing on the land comprised in his \nholding for a residential purpose,  \n(b) intends to use the pucca  structure to be erected on such \nland for a  similar purpose, and  \n(c) has obtained sanction of a building plan to erect the pucca  \nstructure from the municipal authorities of the area in which \nsuch land is situated.  \n(3) No thika  tenant shall be entitled to eject a Bharatia5 from the \nstructure of part thereof in the posse ssion of the Bharatia  for the \npurpose of erecting a pucca  structure:  \nProvided that the thika  tenant may by providing temporary \nalternative accommodation to a Bharatia  obtain from him vacant \npossession of the structure in his possession on condition that \nimmediately on the completion of the construction of the pucca  \nstructure the thika  tenant shall offer the Bharatia  accommodation in \nthe pucca  structure at a rent which shall in no case exceed by more \nthan twenty -five per centum  the rent which the Bharatia  was \npreviously paying.\u201d  \n5.3. It could at once be indicated  that the expression \u201cany structure \u201d as \noccurring in clause (5) of Section 2 of the Act of 1949  as also in the", "(c) has obtained sanction of a building plan to erect the pucca  \nstructure from the municipal authorities of the area in which \nsuch land is situated.  \n(3) No thika  tenant shall be entitled to eject a Bharatia5 from the \nstructure of part thereof in the posse ssion of the Bharatia  for the \npurpose of erecting a pucca  structure:  \nProvided that the thika  tenant may by providing temporary \nalternative accommodation to a Bharatia  obtain from him vacant \npossession of the structure in his possession on condition that \nimmediately on the completion of the construction of the pucca  \nstructure the thika  tenant shall offer the Bharatia  accommodation in \nthe pucca  structure at a rent which shall in no case exceed by more \nthan twenty -five per centum  the rent which the Bharatia  was \npreviously paying.\u201d  \n5.3. It could at once be indicated  that the expression \u201cany structure \u201d as \noccurring in clause (5) of Section 2 of the Act of 1949  as also in the \n \n5 The definition of the term \u201c Bharatia \u201d, as occurring in clause (1) of Section 2 of the Act of 1949 , is \nnot of direct app lication to the present case but , for a proper comprehension of the related provisions, \nthe same is also reproduced as under: - \n\u201c(1) \u201cBharatia \u201d means any person by whom, or on whose account, rent is payable \nfor any structure or part of a structure erected by a thika tenant in his holding ;\u201d  6 \n successor enactments  has been a matter of several debates in the High \nCourt and a substantial number of decisions were rendered in that regard , \nessentially to the effect that the expression \u201cany structure \u201d, in the context \nof the enactment and its purpose, only referred to a temporary structure, \nmore specifically  called  \u201ckutcha  structure \u201d as contradistinguished from a \npermanent structure, which has been referred to as \u201cpucca  structure \u201d. \n5.4. Clause  (6) of Section 2 of the Act of 1949  also has a bearing  in the \npresent case and could be noticed as under: - \n\u201c2. Definitions. - \n  ***   ***   *** \n(6) all words and expressions used but not defined in this Act and \nused in the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (IV of 1882) or the Bengal \nTenancy Act, 1885 (VIII of 18 85), have the same meaning as in \nthose Acts.\u201d  \n6. The aforesaid Act of 1949 was repealed as a whole by the new  \nenactment initially carrying the title of \u2018the Calcutta Thika  Tenancy \n(Acquisition and Regulation) Act, 1981 \u2019. This enactment, promulgated on \n02.11.1981 , came into force with effect from  18.01.1982. Later on, several \namendment s were made to this enactment , including the change of its title \nby way of the Calcutta Thika  Tenancy (Acquisition and Regulation) \n(Amendme nt) Act, 19936. Significantly, the said Amendment Act of 1993 \nwas given retrospective effect from 18.01.1982, i.e., the date of \ncommencement of the principal enactment. With change of name, this \nenactment , being West Bengal Act No. XXXVII of 1981 , came to be known \n \n6 Hereinafter also referred to as \u2018the Amendment Act of 1993 \u2019. 7 \n as \u2018the Calcutta Thika  and Other Tenancies and Lands (Acquisition and \nRegulation) Act , 1981 \u20197. \n6.1. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of this enactment  of the \nyear 1981  could also be usefully noticed as under: - \n\u201cSTATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS  \nThe bharatias  under the Calcutta Thika  Tenancy Act, 1949, are \nvulnerable to the wishes of the thika  tenants with regard to \nenhancement of huts or other structures occupied by them and with \nregard to ejectment therefrom. The provisions o f that Act do not \nprovide for protection of bharatias  against ejectment or \nenhancement of rent at the whims of the thika  tenants. Accordingly, \nthere has been persistent public demand for regulating the relation \nbetween thika  tenants and bharatias . \n2. The thika  tenants pay some rent to the Landlords who are the \nowners of the land. Thus, the landlords continue to remain as \nintermediaries in Calcutta and in the Municipality of Howrah. There \nhas also been a long -standing public demand that each system of \nintermediaries should be abolished and the State Should establish \ndirect thika  tenants so as to regulate the premises held by them.  \n3. The Calcutta Thika  Tenancy (Acquisition and Regulation) Bill \n1980 is intended to meet both these public demands which were \nconsidered just fair and equitable. In order to give some protection \nto the thika  tenants and bharatias  against ejectment, t he Calcutta \nThika  Tenancy Stay of Proceedings (Temporary Provisions) Act, \n1978 was enacted. It came into force on the 19th day of July, 1978. \nThe life of that Act has been extended upto 18th day of July, 1981. \nThe object of that Act was to provide temporar y protection against \nejectment pending enactment of a comprehensive legislation to \nremove the public grievances as already stated. Pending \nproceedings and appeals of ejectment of bharatias  and thika  \ntenants will stand abated.  \n4. This bill is also intended to provide for the acquisition of the rights \nof landlords in lands comprised in thika  tenancies on payment of an \namount calculated at a rate not exceeding ten rupees per square \nmetre on the lines of the amount laid down in the Urban Land \n(Ceiling and Regul ation) Act, 1976 and vesting thereof in the State \nfree from all encumbrances. Thika  tenants shall hold their lands \nunder the State on terms and conditions to be prescribed in the \nrules, and the bharatias  will enjoy the same protection against \nejectment and  enhancement of monthly rent, as enjoyed by the \npremise tenants under the West Bengal Premises, Tenancy Act, \n1956. Since bharatias  constitute a very poor section of the urban \n \n7 Hereinafter this enactment is also referr ed to as \u2018the Act of 1981 \u2019; and whenever contextually \nrequired , is also  referred to by its original name, i.e., Calcutta Thika  Tenancy (Acquisition and \nRegulation) Act , 1981.  8 \n population, it has been provided that, instead of Civil Courts, \ndisputes between bharatias  and thika  tenants will be decided by \nController.  \n5. It is also proposed that the provisions of the West Bengal Land \nHolding Revenue Act, 1979 shall apply to thika  tenants in the matter \nof payment of revenue, but with a separate schedule as shown in \nclause 25 of the Bill.  \n6. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.\u201d  \n6.2. The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the said Amendment \nAct of 1993 had been as under: - \n\u201cSTATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS.  \n \nExperience of the last few years has shown that there are some \npractical difficulties in the operation of the Calcutta Thika  Tenancy \n(Acquisition and Regulation) Act, 1981 . \n2. It has therefore, been considered necessary and expedient -  \na)  to include slums  and bustees  within the purview of the Act;  \nb) to streamline the provisions regarding survey of the thika  \ntenanted land;  \nc)  to make some other, changes as have been felt necessary to \nremove doubts or otherwise to improve the working of the Act.  \n3.  The Bi lls has been framed with the above objects in view.\u201d  \n6.3. The Preamble  of this Act of 1981 was also  substituted by the \nAmendment Act of 1993. For the present purpose, suffice would be to take \nnote of the existing Preamble part of this enactment as follows: - \n\u201cAn Act to provide for the acquisition of interests of landlords in \nrespect of lands comprised in thika  tenancies and certain other \ntenancies and other lands in Calcutta and Howrah for development \nand equitable utilization of such lands.  \nWhereas it is expedient to provide for the acquisition of interests \nof landlords in respect of lands comprised in thika  tenancies and \ncertain other tenancies and other lands in Calcutta and Howrah for \ndevelopment and equitable utilization of such lands with a view to \nsubserving the common good;\u201d  \n6.4. In the Act of 1981, as originally enacted, the terms \u201cpucca  structure \u201d \nand \u201cthika tenant \u201d were defined respectively in clauses (7) and (8) of \nSection 3 in the following terms: - \n\u201c3.    Definitions. - \n   ***   ***   *** 9 \n (7) \"pucca  structure\" means any structure constructed mainly of \nbrick, stone or concrete or any combination of these materials, or \nany other material of a durable nature;  \n(8) \"thika  tenant\" means any person who occupies, whether under \na written lease or otherwise, l and under another person, and is or \nbut for a special contract would be liable to pay rent, at a monthly \nor at any other periodical rate, for that land to that another person \nand has erected or acquired by purchase or gift any structure on \nsuch land for re sidential, manufacturing or business purpose and \nincludes successors -in-interest of such person.\u201d  \n6.5. In this enactment, the text of Section 5 , as originally enacted , and \nas later on substituted by the Amendment Act of 1993 , had been materially \ndifferent and carry their  own relevance for the questions at hand. We may , \ntherefore , usefully reproduce  the text  of Section 5 before and after the \nAmendment of 1993  in juxtaposition , as under: - \nSection 5 as originally enacted . Section 5 as substituted by the \nAmendment Act of 1993.  \n    \"5.

The particular expression \u201ctenant of other lands \u201d as occurring in \nSection 5 after its substitution by the Amendment Act of 1993 was also \ndefined in clause (7B) of Section 3 by way of the same amendment and it \nreads as under8:- \n\u201c3.

In course of \nadministering the said Act, it has come to the notice of the State \n \n8 There had been several other insertions and substitutions by way of the said Amendment Act of \n1993 which need not be noticed for being not relevant in respect to the questions at hand.  \n9 Hereinafter also referred to as \u2018the Act of 2001 \u2019. 11 \n Government that certain provisions of the said Act are still defective, \nleaving scope for addition to existing litigations. It is, therefore, \nnecessary to amend the said provisions.  \n2. The bill has been framed with the above object in view.\u201d  \n7.1. In this enactment  of the year 200 1, the expression  \u201cthika tenant\u201d \ncame to be defined in clause (14) of Section 2. The said clause (14) was \nalso amended by the West Bengal Thika  Tenancy (Acquisition and \nRegulation) (Amendment) Act, 201010 with effect from  01.11.2010 .

Lands comprised in thika  tenancies and other lands, etc. \nto vest in the State. -With effect from the 18th day of January, \n1982, the following lands along with the interest of landlords therein \nshall be deeme d to have vested in the State, free from all \nencumbrances -  \n(a) lands comprised in, and appurtenant to, tenancies of thika  \ntenants including open areas, roads; and  \n(b) lands held in monthly or other periodical tenancies, whether \nunder a written lease or otherwise, for being used or occupied as \nkhatal : \nProvided that any land comprised in, and appurtenant to, \ntenancies of thika  tenants created after the 18th day of Janua ry, \n1982, shall also be deemed to be vested in the State, free from all \nencumbrances with effect from the date of creation of tenancies of \nthika  tenants:  \nProvided further that such vesting shall not be deemed to have \naffected in any way the easements, cust omary rights or other \nfacilities enjoyed by thika  tenants, bharatias  or occupiers of land \ncoming within the purview of this section:  \nProvided also that nothing contained in this section shall prevent \nthe State Government or the local authority from taking up any \ndevelopment work on the land appurtenant to tenancies of thika  \ntenants for public purpose.\u201d  13 \n 7.3.1. Yet further, c lause (a) of  the above -quoted  Section 4 was amended \nby the  Amendment  Act of 2010 and after its amendment , coverage of the \nland for the purpose of vesting in the State was comprehensively provided \nwith the broader expression \u201c thika land\u201d. This clause (a) of Section 4 of  the \nAct of 2001  before and after the amendment could also be placed in \njuxtaposition as under: - \nClause (a) of Section 4 , as \noriginally enacted . Clause (a) of Section 4 , as \nsubstituted by the Amendment \nAct of 2010.  \n\u201c(a) lands comprised in, and \nappurtenant to, tenancies of thika  \ntenants including open areas, \nroads; and \u201d \u201c(a) thika land;\u201d  \n7.4. In order to specify the meaning of the expression \u201c thika land\u201d , \nclause (15) also came to be inserted to Section 2 of the Act of 2001 by way \nof the said Amendment Act of 2010 in the following terms : - \n\u201c2. Definitions. - \n   ***   ***   *** \n(15) \" thika  land\" means any land comprised in and appurtenant to, \ntenancies of thika  tenant irrespective of the fact whether there is any \nclaim of such tenancy or not and includes open areas and roads on \nsuch land.\u201d  \n8.

We shall refer to the other \nprovisions of law at  the appropriate stage and to the extent requisite.   \nBackground and  Factual Matrix  \n9.   As regards  the factual matrix of the present  case, a brief chronology \nof events could  be noticed  as follows:  - 14", "tenants including open areas, \nroads; and \u201d \u201c(a) thika land;\u201d  \n7.4. In order to specify the meaning of the expression \u201c thika land\u201d , \nclause (15) also came to be inserted to Section 2 of the Act of 2001 by way \nof the said Amendment Act of 2010 in the following terms : - \n\u201c2.

We shall refer to the other \nprovisions of law at  the appropriate stage and to the extent requisite.   \nBackground and  Factual Matrix  \n9.   As regards  the factual matrix of the present  case, a brief chronology \nof events could  be noticed  as follows:  - 14 \n 9.1.  One Laxmi Narayan Ghosh  was owner  of the land involved herein \nadmeasuring 2 Bigha s, 10 Kottahs and 3 Chhitacks, more or less, being \nHolding No.  196, Picnic Garden, Tiljala11. The said Laxmi Narayan Ghosh \ndied intestate on or about 23.07. 1950 leaving behind his wife Smt. Nilu \nBala Ghosh and his son Jitendra Nath Ghosh.  Thereafter, Smt. Nilu Bala  \nGhosh died intestate on 07.12.1970  and Jitendra Nath Ghosh became  the \nabsolute owner of the subject  property . \n9.2. On 15.12.1973 , by a registered deed of lease , Jitendra Nath Ghosh \nleased out the subject property to Badri Narayan Kumar and Nema i \nChandra K umar , being the partners  of M/s. Kumar Industries , for a  period \nof 20 years commencing from 01.12. 1973 and expiring on 30.11. 1993 at \nthe rent and on the terms and conditions contained in the said registered \ndeed of lease . \n9.3.  By the said  deed of lease, the lessees were also given the right to \nraise construction on the subject  property and to use and enjoy the same  \nduring the t enure of the lease with a condition that on expiry of the lease \non 30.11. 1993 , the lessees will have to deliver vacant and peaceful \npossession of the said property in the same position as it was at the time \nof execution of lease to the lessor, by removing the construct ion thereon.  \nAdmittedly, the lessees raised some  structure  over t he subject property . \nThe nature of this structure, and its use, have also formed a part of \n \n11 Later on, it came to be  known as the premises at No.195, Picnic Garden Road, Kolkata -700 039 . \nThis being the property involved in the present litigation, is herein referred to as the \u2018subject property \u2019 \nor \u2018the property in question\u2019.  15 \n contentions in this appeal. Hence, we shall elaborate on the same at the \nappropriate juncture.  \n9.4.  On 18.01.1982 , the Act of  1981 came into force and i mmediately \nthere after, the said Jitendra Nath Ghosh ( lessor) filed a writ petition in the \nHigh Court  under Article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging vires  \nthereof . The said writ petition , being  C.R. No. 10449 (W) of 1983 , was \nentertained by the High Court and on  30.09.1983 , an interim order was \npassed therein staying the operation of the impugned Act of 1981  as well \nas Rules framed thereunder insofar as the subject property  was concerned.  \nThereafter, from time to time, var ious orders were passed therein and  \nultimately , the aforesaid writ petition , C.R. No. 10449 (W) of 1983 , was \ndirected to be transferred to the Tribunal for passing appropriate orders.  \n9.5.  In the meantime, the lease granted by the said original owner, \nJitendra Nath Ghosh, in favour of M/s. Kumar Industries, represented by \nits partners  Badri Narayan Kumar and Nemai Chandra Kumar, came to an \nend by efflux of time  on 30.11.1993 .  \n9.6.  After the Act of 2001 came into force, the said M/s. Kumar \nIndustries represented by its partners  filed an application before the \nlearned  Controller  on or about 10.04.2003,  being Return No. 67/234 , for a \ndeclaration that they were thika  tenants of the subject property and claimed \nthat they  had deposited rent with interest with the Controller for the period \nfrom 18.01. 1982 till 2007 . The proceedings on this application filed by the \nlessees have ultimately led to the present appeal.  16 \n 9.7. Before adverting  to the proceedings on the application filed by the \nlessees, another relevant factual aspect is required to be noticed, which \nrelates to dealing with the property in question by the landlord.  A fter \ndemise  of the said Jitendra Nath Ghosh, his heirs, by a deed of conveyance \ndated 10 .09.2007, transferred the property in question  to seven companies \nincluding  the respondent No. 1 Mani Square Ltd.  and also informed the \nAssessor , Tollygunge Tax Department, Kolkata Municipal Corporation \nabout such conveyance by th eir letter dated 13.09.2007. Pursuant to this, \nthe said six companies along with the respondent No. 1 applied before the \nKolkata Municipal Corporation to get their names mutated as owners of the \nproperty in question  in the Municipal records.  It appears tha t the High Court \nof Calcutta, by its order dated 19.09.2008 sanctioned the scheme of \namalgamation whereby, the said six companies were amalgamated with  \nthe respondent No. 1  Mani Square Ltd . and consequently , all the assets \nand properties of the said six co mpanies vested in the respondent No. 1.  \nThereafter, on 15.07.2010, the respondent No. 1 applied before the Kolkata \nMunicipal Corporation in the prescribed form , for mutation of the subject \nproperty  exclusively in its name in the Municipal records. According to the \nrespondent No. 1, only at that stage, it was informed that the Controller had \ndeclared the lessees as thika  tenants over the property in question.  The \nrespondent No. 1 raised objections whereupon, the ma tter was re -\nexamined by the Controller.  This has been the reason that we have two 17 \n orders passed by the Controller in this matter, respectively dated \n27.01.2010 and 01.08.2012.  \nFindings and conclusion of the Controller   \n10. For the questions involved in t his matter, it shall be apposite to take \nnote of the proceedings relating to the said application moved by the \nlessees  and the findings returned  by the  Controller  in necessary details.  \n10.1.  After moving of the application aforesaid, spot enquiry was \nconducted by an enquiry officer on the subject property ; and notices were \nsent to the landlord Jitendra Nath Ghosh and thereafter to Asit  Ghosh. \nHowever, no objection was filed.  \n10.2.  The Controller, in his order dated 27.01.2010 , held that the \napplicants qualified as thika tenants under Section 2(14) of the Act of 2001 \nin respect of 2B , 7K of the land in the subject property. In holding s o, the \nController perused the rent receipts issued on behalf of the then landlords \nto the returnees as well as the copies of the documents endorsing M/s. \nKumar Industries as lessee. The Controller also examined the report of the \nenquiry officer,  which reco mmended thika tenancy while mentioning  the \nexistence of structures like office rooms, asbestos sheds, storage place \netc. along with open space.  \n10.3.  Therefore, the learned Controller declared the applicants  as thika \ntenants. Further to this , the legal heirs of late Badri Narayan Kumar filed an \napplication before the Controller for substitution of their names as thika 18 \n tenants and the learned  Controller substituted the m as thika  tenants in \nplace of late Badri Narayan Kumar.   \n10.4.  As noticed hereinbefore , on 15.07.2010, t he respondent No. 1 , \nunaware of the abovementioned developments  whereby the learned \nController had declared the appellants  as thika  tenants , applied before the \nKolkata Municipal Corporation for mutation of the subject property  \nexclusively in its name in the Municipal records.  In response to the said \napplication for mutation, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation,  by its  \ncommunication dated  28.07.2010 , asked  the respondent No. 1  to submit \ndocumentary evidence to prove as to how the  said seven companies \nbecame owners of the property in question . It had been the case of the \nrespondent No. 1 that in order to find out the present position of the subject \nproperty , enquiries were made and searches were conducted ; and in that \nprocess, it was learnt  that the said ex parte  order d ated 27.01.2010 had \nbeen passed  by the learned Controller  declaring the appellants  as thika \ntenants .  \n10.5.  Having noticed the said order dated 27.01.2010 , the respondent \nNo. 1  filed an application dated 26.08. 2010 before the State Government \nunder Section 13 of the said Act of 2001  whereupon, the Joint Secretary to \nthe Government in its D epartment of Land and Land Reforms, requested \nthe learned C ontroller to dispose of the application of the respondent No. \n1 after giving an opportunity of being heard  to all the concerned.  19 \n 11. Having heard the parties, the Controller proceeded to deal with the \nmatter in his impugned order dated 01.08.2012. Though preliminary \nobjections regarding unexplained delay in filing the return were taken but, \nthe Controller considered it proper to examine the matter on merits rather \nthan on technical grounds.  \n11.1. The Controller, inter alia , observed that  when the lease deed was \nsigned, the Act of 1949 was in force and in terms of Section 2(5) thereof, \nthe following four foundational facts were required to be examined : - \na. Whether the claimant was holding  the land under a written lease, \nor under any other pe rson, and was paying the  rent periodically . \nb. Whether the claimant was holding the land under a lease whose \nduration was expressly stated to be not less than 12 years . \nc. Whether the claimant had erected or acquired (by purchase or \ngift) any structure on the la nd for residential, manufacturing or \nbusiness purpose.", "11. Having heard the parties, the Controller proceeded to deal with the \nmatter in his impugned order dated 01.08.2012. Though preliminary \nobjections regarding unexplained delay in filing the return were taken but, \nthe Controller considered it proper to examine the matter on merits rather \nthan on technical grounds.  \n11.1.

Whether the claimant had erected or acquired (by purchase or \ngift) any structure on the la nd for residential, manufacturing or \nbusiness purpose.  \nd. Whether the claimant was holding  such land or was using or \noccup ying it as khatal . \n11.2. The Controller observed that in the present case, the claimant was  \nnot contending that the land was ever occupied as khatal , so point (d) was \nanswered in the negative. Duration of the lease was also more than 12 \nyears, so point (c) was also negatived. The Controller further observed that \nas per the assessment register of  the Corporation, at all times, there were \npucca  structures on the land; and since the High Court had held in Sri Sri 20 \n Satyanarayan & Ors. v. S.C. Chunder : 2001 (3) CHN 641 , that for a \ntenant to be considered a thika  tenant, no pucca  structures must have been \nraised . Hence , it was found that the lessees  were not thika  tenants per the \nAct of 1949.  The relevant observations and findings of the learned \nController could be usefully extracted from the  typed  copy of the order , as \nplaced bef ore us as Annexure P2 (at p. 95 of the paper -book ): - \n\u201c3. Admittedly, it is not the case of the applicant parties that the said \npremises was ever used or occupied as a khatal. Accordingly, \nclause (iv) of the aforesaid ingredients Can be answered in the \nnegative at the very on set. In my opinion, the test mentione d in \nClause (ii) above regarding duration of the lease has to be \nanswered in the negative as the duration of The Said lease was \nadmittedly for more 12 years. Moreover, the 1947 -48 and 1982 \nassessment register of the Corporation as disclosed by the parties \nclearly show that at all material times there were (and still are) \n\u201cplaces structures at the said premises within the meaning of a \n\u201cpucca structures\u201d under the Thika Act. It is also found that there \nare structures having pucca foundation, pucca floors and pucca wall \nand as disclosed by the report of the said spot enquiry there exist \nbrick built -walls with R.T./Tin shed in the said premises . Applying \nthe ratio of the decision of the Hon\u2019ble High Court at Calcutta in \n2001 (3) CHN 641 (Sri Sri Satyanarayan and  Ors. vs. S.C. \nChunder), for a claimant to be considered a Thika tenant under the \nCalcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949, the structure constructed by \nhim/it in must not be pucca structure. I therefore find that the \napplicant parties did not qualify as thika ten ants under the then \nexisting Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 .\u201d \n(emphasis supplied)  \n11.3. The Controller further observed that the appellants did not qualify \nas thika  tenants under Section 3(8) of the Act of 1981 either, since even \nafter altering the definition, the exclusion of pucca  structures remained.                  \nIt was also found that the lease , based on which the lessees  were claiming \nto be thika  tenants, had  expired on 30.11.1993  and t here was no existing \nrelationship of lessor -lessee between the parties. Hence, on 01.03.2003, \nwhen the provisions of the Act of 2001 came into force, the lessees  had 21 \n become at the highest, lessees at sufferance, having no jural relationship \nwith the lessor; and they being essentially trespassers on the land, were \nnot thika  tenants under Section 2(14) of the Act of 2001. It was also held \nthat the  Act of  1949 and the Act of 1981 were not applicable to the property \nin question . The Controller also observed that the stay order of the High \nCourt was only limited to restricting the application of the Act of 1981  and \nnot the Act of 2001. However, and even  after having held that the \napplicant s were not  thika  tenants and there was no r elationship of landlord \nand tenant on the date when the Act of 2001 came into force, the Controller, \nyet, proceeded to reject the objections with reference to the fact of erection \nof pucca  brick wall over the property in question while observing that in \nview of the decision of Calcutta High Court in the case of  Purushottam \nDas Murarka v. Harendra Krishna Mukherjee : 79 CWN 852 , subsequent \nerection of brick wall will not take the applicant s outside the definition of \nthika  tenant.  \n11.4. The relevant observations and conclusion of the learned Controller \ncould also be usefully  extracted from the  typed  copy of the order , as placed \nbefore us as Annexure P2 (at pp.  101-104 of the paper -book ): - \n\u201c13. This authority also finds that that the leas e granted by the \nconcerned landlords to the said lessee, on the strength of which the \napplicant parties are claiming to be thika tenants, expired on 30 th \nNovember 1993. After such expiry, there was no relationship of \nLessor -Lessee between be owners of the concerned premises and \nthe applicant parties. Accordingly, on 1st March, 2003, when the \nprovisions of the West Bengal Thika Tenancy (Acquisition and \nRegulation) Act, 2001 came into force, the ere -lessees  (sic) had \nbecome at the highest lessees at sufferance having no jural \nrelationship with the lessor. The judgment cited by the objector for \nthis proposition i.e. AIR 1928 Cal 753 is squarely applicable to the 22 \n facts of the case. Going by that judgment, the applic ant parties \nbecame trespassers or at the highest tenants at sufferance after \nexpiry of lease. Therefore, they cannot qualify as thika tenants \nwithin the meaning of Section 2(14) of Section 2(14) of the said Act \nof 2001 and the said premises cannot qualify thika land within the \nmeaning of Section 2(15) of the said Act of 2001 . From the relevant \nrecords which are now before this Forum, it is abundantly clear that \nneither the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 or the Calcutta Thika \nTenancy (Acquisition and Regul ation) Act, 1981 or any Rules \nframed thereunder could ever be applicable to the said premises. \nThe receipts granted by the landlords describing the lessees as \nthika proja as claimed by the applicant, parties, cannot help the \napplicant parties. It appears t hat the said receipts are general \nreceipts, catering both to monthly and thika tenants and the \nissuance thereof cannot ipso facto clothe the grantees -applicant \nparties with the status of thika tenancy. That apart, the status of the \napplicant parties has to  be culled out from the provisions of law the \nregistered lease deed and not from the private description provided \nin certain rent receipts. The claim of Thika tenancy of the applicant \nparties on the basis of this rent bill / receipt is therefore doubtful . \n14. The objector has referred to a writ petition filed on 30th \nSeptember, 1983 where an order of stay of operation of Calcutta \nThika Tenant (Acquisition & Regulation) Act, 1981 was Made. \nAccording to the objector, this order is still subsisting which would  \nnegate the application of 2001 Act to the land in question. I reject \nthis proposition since the Said order was expressly restricted to the \n1981 Act. Therefore the order cannot be interpreted to apply to the \n2001 Act and/or the 2010 Amendment Act,  \n15. Even though I have held that the applicant parties were \nnot tenants nor there was any Landlord -Tenant relationship as on \nthe date when the 2001 Act came into force and consequently is on \nthe date of the 2010 Amendment, I am constrained to reject the \napplicati on by the objector  n (sic-on?) the last point urged by the \napplicant parties that is malting  (sic) of pucca brick wall does not \nexclude the applicant parties from the definition of thika tenant. I \naccept the proposition laid down in 729 CWN 852 relied on b y the \napplicant parties to hold that subsequent erection of brick wall will \nnot take the applicant parties outride  (sic) the definition of thika \ntenant. Therefore, the applicant parties were indeed thika tenants \nand the judgment reported in 79 CWN 852 is s quarely applicable to \ntheir case. On that basis I have no option but to reject the application \nof the objector . \n I accordingly hold  that Bari Narayan Kumar, since deceased and \nNemai  Chandra Kumar were the Thika Tenants in the subject \npremises.  \n After expiry of Badri Narayan Kumar on 06/07/2006, Sint. Jharna \nKumar, Sri Debashis Kumar, Smt. Sanchita Paul, Sudipta Kumar & 23 \n Smt. Jyotsna Roy, alongwith Sri Nemai Chandra Kumar are \ndeclared as Jt. Thika Tenants.  \n Thus the earlier order of Thika Tenancy Controller dt. \n27.01.2010, stands.  \n The matter is accordingly disposed of on contest.\u201d  \n(emphasis supplied)  \n11.5. Hence, objections of the respondent  No. 1  were rejected. It was \nheld that Badri Narayan Kumar and Nemai Chandra were thika  tenants, \nand after the expiry of Badri Narayan Kumar, his legal heirs were joint thika \ntenants.  \nFindings of the Tribunal  \n12.

The Tribunal, in its elaborate judgment relied upon various \nauthorities and referred to various principles but the crux of its \nconsideration had been the overriding impact and effect of the Act of 2001. \nAs regards the structure in question, the Tribuna l held it  to be \u201csemi -pucca \u201d 24 \n but, again observe d that all types of structures were included within the \nmeaning of \u201cany structure \u201d in the definition of thika  tenant in the Act of 2001, \nwhich was a beneficial legislation.  \n12.2. Some of the observations and findings of the Tribunal could be \nusefully extracted from the typed copy of its judgment placed before us as \nAnnexure P5  (at pp. 200 -207 of the paper -book) , which would read as \nunder: - \n\u201c16.3 By such amendment confusion and ambiguity to interpret the \nwords \"any structure\" has been totally dispelled. A particular Thika \nLand may now vest in the state with effect from 18.01.1982 in a suo -\nmotu proceeding, even if there is no claimant as on 01. 03.2003. Any \nsuo-motu proceeding initiated prior to the instant O.A. the impugned \nproceeding was initiated on the basis of question raised by the \napplicant before the Government in the year 2010 and challenging \nthereby the decision dated 27.01.2010 of the Thika Controller. We \ncannot interpret the law otherwise so that the leasing out of land \nbecomes operative again after complete abolition of Zamindari \nSystem by the W.B.E.A. Act, 1953.  \n16.4 If it is presumed that the respondents were not a Thika Tenant \nin terms of the provisions of the Act, 1981, then the impugned \nproceeding initiated by the Controller  recognizing the occupiers on \nthe land taken on lease prior to 18.01.1982 is a valid proceeding as \nthe respondents were in possession on 18.01.1982 and again o n \n01.03.2003. The respondents became Thika Tenant under the Act, \n2001 and the suit land vested in the state with effect from \n18.01.1982.  \n***    ***    *** \n16.5 It is an admitted fact that the structure constructed on the suit \nland by the respondents was wi th tin shed. The tin shed structure \nwas made with authority given by the landlord and hence the same \nwas not unauthorized. The nature of the structure is undoubtedly \nsemi -pucca. The tin -shed structure cannot be a pucca structure \nwithin the meaning of pucca  structure in the Act, 1981 after 1993 \nAmendment as all the materials are not of durable nature. Again, all \ntypes of structures are included within the meaning of 'any structure' \nin the definition of Thika Tenant in the Act, 2001 . \n***    ***    *** \n17\u2026 The Act 2001 is a beneficent statute having a chequered \nhistory making gradual headways to grant benefit to the occupier on \nlands belonging to others and to sub -serve common good. Hence, \nthere is no doubt, whatsoever, that the substituted words \"any 25 \n structure  including pucca structure\" operate with effect from \n18.01.1982, the date given retrospective effect in the Act, 2001 \nbefore amendment Act, 2010 was brought in the Statute . \n***    ***    *** \n18.1 \u2026 It might happen that a particular occupier could not be \ndeclared as Thika Tenant in view of the provisions of the Act, 1981 \n& the Act, 1949. But in view of the provisions of Sec. 3 inserted in \nthe Act, 2001 conferring over -riding effect to the provisions of the \nAct, fresh declaration/ determination is not a bar in  the perspective \nof this radically amended Act as because legislature enacted law \nwith retrospective effect and as because observations from a \njudgment have to be considered in light of the questions which were \nbefore the Court. But there was no scope to p lace before the Court \nthe new issues for decisions in the past as the questions / issues \nwere not existing at the time of past decisions prior to the enactment \nof the Act, 2001. Because of subsequent legislation in 2001, there \nhas been effective changes of  the pre -existing statutory provisions \nwith retrospective effect. Hence, it is well settled that the previous \njudgement may be reviewed .\u201d \n(emphasis supplied)  \n12.3. Thus, the Tribunal proceeded on the finding that even if the \noccupier could not be declared to be a thika  tenant under the Act of 1949 \nor the Act of 1981, the decision could be reviewed because of the change \nin the pre -existing statutory provisions with re trospective effect. As regard s \nthe matter of filing of return, the Tribunal observed that such filing was \nmeaningless because its purpose was for taking  consequential action and \nit was only apprising the Controller of the particular land  but, was not linke d \nwith vesting , which occurred due to the operation of law. The Tribunal , \ntherefore, found no reason to interfere with the findings of the Controller \nand proceeded to dismiss the appeal.   \n13. Aggrieved by the decisions aforesaid, the respondent No. 1 \npreferred a writ petition in the High Court , being W.P.L.R.T. No. 325 of \n2013 , which  was considered and allowed by the High Court by its impugned 26 \n judgment and order dated 10.03.2014 while holding that the present \nappellants did not qualify as thika tenants.  \nFindings of the Calcutta High Court  \n14.    Having regard to the submissions made and the questions involved \nin this matter, we may also take note of the reasoning of the High Court in \nnecessary details.  \n14.1.  The High Court referred to the relevant background aspects and \nfindings of the Controller  and the Tribunal and then, particularly noticed the \nadmitted position that the lessees had raised pucca  structure having pucca  \nfoundation, pucca  floor and pucca  wall with partly tin and partly tile shed on \nthe roof and used the premises, including the str ucture constructed thereat \nfor running their factory activities. The High Court also took note of the facts \nrelating to the enforcement of the Act of 19 81 and challenge thereto by the \nlandlord by way of writ petition, wherein an interim order  was passed,  \nstaying operation of the said enactment  qua the property in question. The \nHigh Court also specifically took note of the fact that the lessees never \nclaimed themselves as thika  tenants before filing the return , which they \nfiled on 10.04.2003 , only after the advent of the Act of 2001.  The High \nCourt, thereafter, proceeded to deal with the principal questions involved \nin the matter with reference to the said three thika  tenancy enactments \nwhile pointing out that the tenancy in favour of the predecessor -in-interest \nof the present appellants was created when the Act of 1949 was in \noperation ; was subsisting when the Act of 1981 came into operation ; and 27 \n the present appellants were claiming thika  tenancy rights under the Act of \n2001.  \n14.2.  Proceeding with the definition of \u201cthika  tenant\u201d, as contained in \nSection 2 (5) of the Act of 1949 , the High Court observed that t he lease \nhaving been granted in favour of the lessees for a period of more than 12 \nyears i.e., for 20 years and the lessee s having constructed pucca  structure \nhaving pucca foundation, pucca  floor and pucca  walls with tile and tin shed \non the roof in contradistinction to any kutcha  or temporary structure as \ncontemplated under the said Act, the said lessees cannot be regarded as \nthika tenants within the  ambit of Section 2(5) of the Act of 1949.  \n14.3.  Furthermore, noting that the expression \u201cany structure \u201d in Section \n2(5) of the Act of 19 49 had been interpreted to mean only temporary or \nkutcha  structure and not permanent or pucca  structure in Jatadhari Daw \n& Grandsons v. Smt Radha De bi & Anr. : 1986  (1) CHN 2 1, which was \nalso approved in the Full Bench decision of the High Court in the case of \nLakshmimoni Das and Ors. v. State of West Bengal and Ors. : AIR 1987 \nCal 326, the Court cleared the clouds  upon the question as to  whether the \npresent case qualifie d the requirement of \u201cany structure \u201d by concluding in \nthe negative. The High Court, inter alia , observed and held as under (at p. \n14 of the impugned order): -  \n\u201cConsidering  the nature of the construction which was made mainly \nof bricks as mentioned above we cannot hold that the structure \nwhich was constructed by the then lessee was either temporary or \nKutcha structure.  As such we can safely hold that this part of the \nrequirement of Section 2(5) of the said Act, was not fulfilled in the \ninstant case.\u201d   \n(emphasis supplied)  28 \n 14.4.  On the point of applicability of Section 10A inserted to the main Act \nof 1949 by way of amen dment in the year 1969 which gave right to thika \ntenants to erect pucca  structure for residential purpose with previous \npermission of the Controller, the Court noted that since the present", "Cal 326, the Court cleared the clouds  upon the question as to  whether the \npresent case qualifie d the requirement of \u201cany structure \u201d by concluding in \nthe negative. The High Court, inter alia , observed and held as under (at p. \n14 of the impugned order): -  \n\u201cConsidering  the nature of the construction which was made mainly \nof bricks as mentioned above we cannot hold that the structure \nwhich was constructed by the then lessee was either temporary or \nKutcha structure.  As such we can safely hold that this part of the \nrequirement of Section 2(5) of the said Act, was not fulfilled in the \ninstant case.\u201d   \n(emphasis supplied)  28 \n 14.4.  On the point of applicability of Section 10A inserted to the main Act \nof 1949 by way of amen dment in the year 1969 which gave right to thika \ntenants to erect pucca  structure for residential purpose with previous \npermission of the Controller, the Court noted that since the present \nappellants did  not qualify the requirements of being a thika tenant under \nSection 2(5), they had no right to raise a pucca structure under  Section 10A \nof the said Act.  Furthermore, the present appellants  never claimed that they \nraised pucca  structure  with the permission of th e Controller.  Therefore,  it \nwas concluded that the y cannot be declared as thika tenants under the Act \nof 1949.  \n14.5.  Moving on to the point as to  whether the respondents would qualify \nas thika tenants under Section 3(8) of the Act of 1981,  the Court examined \nthe relevant provisions and held that  the requirements under this Section \n3(8) were  exactly the same as were  under Section 2(5) of the Act of 1949 \nexcept the exclusion part s; and thus, by deleting and/or omitting the said \nexclusion part s of the Act of 19 49 from the definition of thika  tenant under \nSection 3(8) of the Act of 1981, the lessees under a lease even for more \nthan 12 years were also brought under the purview of thika  tenancy but, \nthe other essential conditions  remained the same namely, those of  the \ntenant's liability to pay rent under a lease or otherwise as also the \nrequirement that  such tenant ha d erected or acquired by purchase or gift \nany structure on such land either for residential or manufacturing or \nbusiness purpose.  29 \n 14.6.  The High Court  took note of the fact that the Act of 19 81 came into \noperation with effect from 18.01.1 982 and then, found that as per the \nadmitted facts of the case, while the requirement of liability to  pay rent for \nthe demised land continued until 30.11.1993  as per th eir lease deed  but, \nthe lessees  failed to fulfil the other half of requirement , i.e.,  of erecting  or \nacquiring  a kutcha  or temporary structure . The  High Court held that the  \npucca  structure erected on the demised land by the lessees  cannot be \nconsidered within the ambit of \u201cany structure \u201d. The High Court, inter alia , \nheld as under (at pp. 17-18 of the impugned order): - \n\u201cSince the said tenancy continued till 30th November, 1993 it \ncannot  be disputed that the said tenant had liability to pay rent for \nthe demised land to their landlord till 30th November, 1993. Thus, \nthis part of the requirement under Section 3 (8) of the said Act is \nfulfilled in the instant case. However, the other re quirement i.e., \nerection and/or acquisition by purchase or gift, any structure on \nsuch land by the tenant for residential, manufacturing or business \npurpose, is not satisfied in the instant case as admittedly the said \nlessee did not raise any kutcha struct ure and/or temporary structure \non the demised land. We have already indicated above that the \nexpression \"structure\" used in Section 3(8) of the said Act should \nbe construed as \"kutcha\" structure and/or temporary structure in \ncontra -distinction to the perma nent or \"pucca\" structure as was held \nby the Division Bench of this Hon'ble Court in the case of Jatadhari \nDaw & Grandsons -Vs- Smt. Radha Devi & Anr. (Supra) which was \nsubsequently affirmed by the Full Bench of this Hon'ble Court in the \ncase of Lakshmimon i Das -Vs- State of West Bengal (Supra) .\u201d \n(emphasis supplied)  \n14.7.  The High Court, thereafter, took up for consideration a somewhat \nticklish issue pertaining to this case, being related with the effect of \nretrospective amendment of Section 5 of the Act of 2001 . After an elaborate \nreference to the unamended provisions as also the amended provisions \nwhich were given retrospective effect from the very date of commencement 30 \n of the original enactment, the High Court also took note of all the salient \nfeatures o f the pronouncement of the Full Bench in the case of Lakshmimoni \nDas (supra)  and then, analysed the position of law in the following words  (at \npp.36 -40 of the impugned order) : -  \n\u201cThus  we find that the Full Bench of this Hon'ble Court held in no \nuncertain term in the said Lakshmimoni Das's case (Supra) that no \nother land save and except the thika tenancy land and khatal land, \ncould be vested under the original provision of Section 5 of the Act \nof 1981. Now let us consider the effect of the amended provision of \nSection 5 of the Act of 1981 which the Special Bench had no \noccasion to consider as the said amended provision was introduced \nin the Act of 1981 after the judgment was delivered by  the Special \nBench in Lakshmimoni Das's case (Supra).  \n On plain reading of the amended provision of Section 5 of the \nsaid Act, it appears to us that apart from thika tenancy property \nand/or the khatal land, some other land which was neither thika \ntenancy l and nor khatal land, was sought to be vested under \nSection 5(c) of the said Act.  \n We feel that deep analysis of this provision is necessary to find \nout the real intention of the legislature in introducing the said \namendment. Did the State Legislature reall y intend to vest land of \nany description which was let out to tenant either under a written \nlease or otherwise? Had it really been so, then while enacting a new \nlegislation on the very same subject in 2001, the State Legislature \nwould not have omitted the provision regarding vesting of other land \nwhich was there in the Act of 1981 from the Act of 2001.  \n If we compare the original provision of Section 5 of the Act of \n1981 with the amended provision of Section 5, then it appears to us \nthat the provision relat ing to vesting of thika land and other land \neither occupied and/or used as khatal which was there in the original \nprovision of Section 5 was retained in the amended provision of \nSection 5 of the said Act. What more was introduced in the \namended provision w as vesting of Bustee land situated in the khas \nland of the landlord, land in slum areas and other land which was \nneither thika tenancy land nor Bustee land, nor land in slum area \nnor land occupied and/or used as khatal. Then what was actually \nintended by i ntroducing the provision of vesting of other land under \nSection 5 (c) of the amended provision? Other land was defined in \nSection 3 (5A) which included vacant land or tank. Tenant of other \nland was defined in Section 3(7B) of the amended provision which \nsays that tenant of other land means any person who occupies other \nland under another person, whether under a written lease or \notherwise, and is or but for a special contract would be liable to pay \nrent at a monthly or periodical rate for occupation of such other \nlands, and includes the successor -in-interest of such person. Thus, 31 \n if Section 5 (c) is read conjointly with Section 3(5A) and Section \n3(7B) then it leads us to hold that whenever any land including \nvacant land or tank is let out to a tenant by the l andlord even for a \nday or a month at a daily or monthly rate, the landlord's interest in \nsuch land will vest in the State under Section 5 (c) of the said Act \nby overriding the provision of the Transfer of Property Act (Central \nLaw) governing the relationsh ip of landlord and tenant. If we hold \nas such , it will lead to absurdity. Probably the State Legislature, \nafter considering the absurdity and/or impossibility of \nimplementation of the amended provision of the Act of 1981, \ndropped the idea of vesting of ot her land and accordingly omitted \nthe said provisions while legislating on the same subject in 2001. \nSuch intention of the legislature will be clear, if we consider the \nState Legislature's choice of the date of enforcement of 2001 Act. \nIn fact two contradic tory provisions cannot co -exist and operate \nsimultaneously in the same field. When the subsequent legislation \nconveys a different intention relating to the laws of vesting than that \nof the idea of vesting introduced in the earlier Act, it goes without \nsaying that the earlier Act was repealed. Having regard to the fact \nthat the Act of 2001 was given effect from the very same date on \nwhich the Act of 1981 was enforced, we have no hesitation to hold \nthat State Legislature practically abandoned its idea of vest ing of \nany other land apart from thika tenancy land and khatal land as on \n18.01.1982 and this conclusion is drawn by us as we find that the \nAct of 2001 was given retrospective effect from the very same date \nwhen the Act of 1981 was enforced. Again if the p rovisions of the \nAct of 2001 is considered, then it goes without saying that the \nprovision relating to vesting of landlord's interest in the thika tenancy \nand khatal land was made in the said statute in conformity with the \nFull Bench Decision of this Court  in Lakshmimoni Das's case \n(Supra).  Omission of the provision relating to vesting of other land \nwas also made in conformity with the said decision of the Full Bench \nDecision in Lakshmimoni Das's case (Supra). As such, we have no \nhesitation to hold that ide a of vesting the landlord's interest in the \nother land in the State under the Act of 1981 was abandoned by the \nState. However, in view of the savings clause provided in the Act of \n2001, the vesting which had already taken place under the Act of", "18.01.1982 and this conclusion is drawn by us as we find that the \nAct of 2001 was given retrospective effect from the very same date \nwhen the Act of 1981 was enforced. Again if the p rovisions of the \nAct of 2001 is considered, then it goes without saying that the \nprovision relating to vesting of landlord's interest in the thika tenancy \nand khatal land was made in the said statute in conformity with the \nFull Bench Decision of this Court  in Lakshmimoni Das's case \n(Supra).  Omission of the provision relating to vesting of other land \nwas also made in conformity with the said decision of the Full Bench \nDecision in Lakshmimoni Das's case (Supra). As such, we have no \nhesitation to hold that ide a of vesting the landlord's interest in the \nother land in the State under the Act of 1981 was abandoned by the \nState. However, in view of the savings clause provided in the Act of \n2001, the vesting which had already taken place under the Act of \n1981 in res pect of thika tenancy land and khatal land was saved. \nThat apart having regard to the fact that the operation of the Act of \n1981 in respect of the petitioners' property was stayed by this court, \nthe landlord's interest in the said premises could not have v ested \nunder 1981 Act. Then again the private respondent also did neither \nsubmit any return under 1981 Act claiming their tenancy under the \nState nor did they ever claim the landlord's interest vested under \nthe said Act. \u201d \n(emphasis supplied)  \n 14.7.1. In view of the above, the High Court held that the landlord's interest \nin the subject  property never vested in the State under the Act of 1981 . 32 \n 14.8.  Moving on  to the Act of 2001, the High Court held that even \nthereunder, the landlord\u2019s interest never vest ed in the State. In this regard, \nthe Court examined the provision of Section 2(14) of the Act of 2001 , again, \nas originally enacted and as amended by the Act of 2010 and then, held as \nunder (at pp.  41-42 of the impugned order ): -  \n\u201cThe definition of thika tenant under Section 2 (14) of 2001 Act \nas mentioned above was almost identical with the definition of thika \ntenant as mentioned in Section 3(8) of 1981 Act except the \nexclusion part regarding structure which stood forfeited to the State \nunder Sub -Section 2(6) of the said Act. The definition of thika tenant \nin Section 2(14) of Act of 2001 was amended by the Amendment \nAct of 2010 and thereby the words \"by purchase or gift any structure \non such land\" was substituted by the words \"by purchase or gift any \nstruc ture including pucca structure if any on such land\". Thus the \nexpression \"pucca structure\" was included in the definition clause \nof Section 2 (14) of the said Act for the first time by the Amendment \nAct of 2010 and effect of such amendment was given prospe ctively \nwith effect from 1st November, 2010 . The effect of the amendment \nwas not given from the date when the 2001 Act came into operation \nfrom 18th July, 1981. Thus, existence of pucca structure on the said \nland as on 1st November, 2010 will itself be of no help to the private \nrespondent inasmuch as on 1st November, 2010 there was no \nsubsisting lease and/or contract under which original lessees were \nliable to pay rent to their landlords in respect of the land comprising \nin the said premises. The lease date d 15th December, 1973 expired \nby efflux of time on 30th September, 1993. After expiry of the said \nlease, the lessees became trespassers and/or at best they may be \nregarded as tenant by sufferance who had no liability to pay rent to \ntheir landlord either un der the said lease which stood expired in \n1993 or under any other law. Thus, the first part of the requirement \nof Section 2(14) of the said Act is not fulfilled in the instant case . As \nsuch the land which was comprising in the said tenancy of the \npredecess or-in-interest of the private respondent cannot vest with \nthe State under Section 4 of the said Act. \u201d \n(emphasis supplied)  \n14.9.  The High Court agreed with the contention that the expression \n\u201cstructure including pucca  structure \u201d, was included in S ection  2(14) of the Act  \nof 2001  only for recognizing the tenancy of those thika  tenants who \nconstructed these pucca  structures with permission of t he Controller under 33 \n provisions of the Act of 1949 or the Act of 1981, with the building plan \nsanctioned by the Municipal Corporation . The High Court further held that the \ndecision in  Purushottam Das Murarka  (supra)  was misconstrued by the \nController while holding the present appellants to be thika  tenants since \npucca  structures were raised during continuance of the lease. The Court \npointed out that a different principle was laid down in that case, and both the \nContro ller and the Tribunal misconstrued it ; and held that the impugned \norder s, thus, remained wholly unsustainable in the following words: - \n\u201cIn fact, this was the decision which was misconstrued by the \nThika Controller while drawing his conclusion that since t hika tenant \nraised pucca construction during continuance of his lease, they \nbecame thika tenant. In our reading, we find a different principle was \nlaid down in the said decision which could not be properly \nunderstood by the controller and the Tribunal whic h ultimately \naffirmed the Controller's said order. It was simply decided therein \nthat if a thika tenant raises any pucca construction during the \ncontinuance of his lease without the landlord's consent, then the \nlandlord may initiate action for demolition o f such unauthorized \nconstruction. It was never held in the said decision, that if tenant of \na land raises pucca structure, he will automatically be a thika tenant. \nSince the said decision was the sheet anchor for coming to the \nconclusion that the private r espondents were thika tenant, we \ncannot approve the said order of the Controller for the aforesaid \nreason. \u201d \n14.10.  In view of the above discussion and findings, the High Court held \nthat the Controller and the Tribunal were not justified in holding that the \npresent appellant s were thika  tenants in respect of the subject property  and \nthe landlord's interest therein  vested with the State under the Act of 2001 \nwith effect from 18 .01.1 982. Hence, the  writ petition was allowed.  \n14.11 . Being aggrieved by the order so passed by the High Court, the \nappellants have preferred this appeal.  34 \n Previous decision of this appeal and  review thereof  \n15. Before proceeding further, we may point out that this appeal against \nthe said judgment and order dated 10.03.2014 was earlier considered and \ndecided by  a co-ordinate bench of this Court by way of  the judgment dated \n24.02.2015. Therein,  the matter was essentially considered with reference \nto the provisions contained in Section 2(5) of the Act of 1949 as also the \nlater inserted Section  2(4a) and Section 10A to the Act of 1949; and while \nholding that the  intention of legislature was clear that the expression \u201cany \nstructure \u201d would include both kutcha  (temporary) and pucca  (permanent) \nstructure, it was concluded that the appellants fulfilled all the conditions of \nthika tenan cy as defined in Section 2(5) of the Act of 1949. In consequence \nto this finding and with reference to the Act of 1981, it was held that the \nproperty  in question vested in the State along with interest of landlord free \nfrom all incumbrances.  \n16. A review petition bearing No. 1483 of 2015 was filed in the matter \nseeking review of the judgment aforesaid, which was considered and \nallowed by us on 04.03.2021. After noticing the provisions contained in \nSection 2(5) and particular ly the  excepted  category of the lease beyond 12 \nyears, it was  observed  that the judgment under review suffered from an \nerror apparent on the face of the record because  the crucial fact, that the \nperiod of lease in the present case was of 20 years , was not even taken \ninto consideration. The question as to whether the  appellants were entitled \nto succeed on the basis of the provisions of the Act of 1981 was , of course , 35 \n left open because the same had not been considered in the judgment under \nreview. Therefore, we allowed the review petition and restored the appeal \nfor re consideration  while observing, inter alia, as under: - \n \u201cOne of the excepted categories in Section 2(5) of the 1949 Act \npostulates that the definition will have no application to lease \nbeyond 12 years period. On this count alone, the finding of fact \nrecord ed by this Court in the judgment under review and the \ndeclaration given in favour of respondent No. 1 on that basis cannot \nstand, being a manifest error apparent on the face of record and \nalso contrary to the express statutory provision.  \n The question whether the appellants in Civil Appeal could \notherwise succeed on the other arguments, including that they had \nprotection under the provisions of The Calcutta Thika and other \nTenancies and Lands (Acquisition and Regulation) Act, 1981 (for \nshort, \u2018the 1981 Act\u2019), of being the Thika Tenant(s) and that the \npucca structure erected by them was also protected/covered under \nthat provision, is a matter which needs to be examined in the revived \ncivil appeal.  \n Indeed, the judgment under review refers to  the provision \nSection 3(8) of the 1981 Act, but there is no analysis in the judgment \nas to how the appellant (Respondent No.1 herein) would acquire \nthe status of thika tenant  as such. It is only then the issue of vesting \nunder the 1981 Act can be taken fo rward.  \n Counsel for the respondent(s) was at pains to persuade us that \neven if the judgment under consideration is reviewed, the \nconclusion in favour of respondent No. 1 would remain the same. \nAgain, that is a matter to be considered in the civil appeal, \nconsequent to the recall of judgment dated 24th February, 2015. All \ncontentions available to both sides in the revived appeal can be \nconsidered on its own merits. We order accordingly.", "short, \u2018the 1981 Act\u2019), of being the Thika Tenant(s) and that the \npucca structure erected by them was also protected/covered under \nthat provision, is a matter which needs to be examined in the revived \ncivil appeal.  \n Indeed, the judgment under review refers to  the provision \nSection 3(8) of the 1981 Act, but there is no analysis in the judgment \nas to how the appellant (Respondent No.1 herein) would acquire \nthe status of thika tenant  as such.

The foregoing had been the summary of the entire background in \nwhich this appeal was heard at length by us. We may now usefully \nsummarise the contentions urged on behalf of the contesting parties.    36 \n The Appellants  \n18. Learned senior counsel for the appell ants has assailed the order \nimpugned with a variety of submissions concerning operation and effect of \nthe thika tenancy enactments.  \n18.1. It has been submitted by the learned senior counsel that the term \n\u201cany structure\u201d, as used in the Act of 1949, includes both kutcha  and pucca  \nstructures. The learned counsel has relied upon  the decision of this Court \nin Chief Inspector of Mines and Anr. v. Lala Karam  Chand Thapar  and \nOrs.: (1962) 1 SCR 9 to contend that \u201cany\u201d as referred to in the term \u201cany \nstructure\u201d in Section 2(5) of the Act of 1949, means \u201call\u201d. It has been \nsubmitted that words/phrases in a statue ought to be construed as per their \nplain language ; and the decisions in Om Prakash Gupta v. DIG \nVijendrapal Gupta: (1982) 2 SCC 61, Bharat Aluminium Company v. \nKaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc. : (2012) 9 SCC 552, Union of \nIndia & Anr. v. Hansoli Devi  & Ors. : (2002) 7 SCC 273  and Vijay \nNara yan Thatte  and Ors.  v. State of Maharashtra  and Ors. : (2009) 9 \nSCC 92 have been  relied upon.  \n18.2. It has also been contended that  the case of  Monmatha Nath \nMukherjee v. Smt. Banarasi  and Ors. : 63 CWN 824  had wrongly been \ndecided, and that there exists no other authority, apart from this case  for \nthe proposition that the term \u201cany structure\u201d in Section 2(5) of the Act of \n1949 is only confined to kutcha  structure. It has further been submitted that \nJatadhari Daw & Grandsons (supra)  merely relied on Monmatha  Nath  37 \n Mukherjee  (supra) , and in fact , Jatadhari Daw  & Grandsons  has been \nset aside by the Supreme Court by its order dated 27.10.2004. It has also \nbeen contended that the judgement in Kshiroda  Moyee Sen  and Ors.  v. \nAshutosh Roy  and Ors. : 63 CWN 5 65 is being misread, since it was not \nheld that \u201cany structure\u2019\u201d in Sectio n 2(5) meant kutcha  structure, but was \nactually held to the contrary ; and that the Act of 1949 does not restrict the \nstructures to kutcha  structures and that the nature of these structures would \ndepend upon the terms of the contract between the parties. It  has also been \nsubmitted that it was held by the High Court in Kshiroda  Moyee  Sen \n(supra) that a thika tenant was not entitled to put up pucca structures on \nthe land merely because he had taken the land on thika tenancy but, while \nthere was no right to put up pucca structures, the landlord was only entitled \nto seek a decree of injunction. The learned counsel has also referred to  \nJnan  Ranjan Sen Gupta  and Ors.  v. Arun Kumar Bose : (1975) 2 SCC \n526, wherein it was held that the Act of 1949 was a beneficial legislation, \nand should be liberally interpreted in favour of the tenants, and that if two \ninterpretations were  possible, the one in favour o f the tenant should be \nupheld . \n18.3. The learned senior counsel has also submitted  that the reliance on \nSection 108( p) of the Transfer of Property Act, 188212-13 to interpret the Act \n \n12 Hereinafter also referred to as \u2018the Transfer of Property Act\u2019. \n13 Clause (p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act dealing with rights and liabilities of the \nlessee  enjoins upon the lessee that, - \n\u201c(p) he must not, without the lessor\u2019s consent, erect on the property any \npermanent structure, except for agricultu ral purposes;\u201d  38 \n of 1949 is erroneous, since a special statute  like the Act of 1949 overrides \na general statute  like the Transfer of Property Act ; and  Section 108( p) of \nthe Transfer of Property Act does not lay down that permanent structures \ncannot be constructed by a tenant .  \n18.4. It has been contended by the learn ed senior counsel that  the \ninsertion of Section 10A  by the  Amendment Act of 1969  had been  only to \nthe effect that if otherwise the thika tenant was not permitted to build pucca \nstructures under the terms of the lease with the landlord, he could have \ndone s o with permission of the Controller. Section 10A shows intent of the \nlegislature to include lands in which the tenant has erected or acquired \npermanent structures.  \n18.5. As regards the interpretation of thika tenant and the phrase \u201cany \nstructure\u201d under the Act of 1981, the learned senior counsel for the \nappellant s has argued  that they are not being correctly interpreted. The \nconcept of thika tenancy under the Act of 1981 was much wider than the \none under the Act of 1949, wherein the temp orariness of the concept of \nthika tenancy was removed. The term \u201cother lands\u201d was not in place at the \ninception, and was inserted by way of the Amendment Act of 1993.  The \nlearned counsel would  submit that the legal position on the nature of \nconstruction is  clearer after the Amendment Act of 1993, since all thika  \ntenancies, as defined under Section 3(8) of the Act of 1981, stood vested \nwith the State with effect from 18.01.1982 ; and the concept of \u201cother lands\u201d \nwas introduced by virtue of Section 5(c) . 39 \n 18.6. The learned counsel has further submitted that the property in \nquestion continued to be under thika tenancy after the Act of 2001, since \nthe acquisition was carried out retrospectively ; and it was expressly stated \nin Section 4 that it would take effect f rom 18.01.1982. Furthermore, the \nlearned counsel has submitted that the amendment to the definition of thika \ntenancy by way of the Amendment Act of 2010 was only clarificatory in \nnature, and merely confirmed what was always the position, that the nature \nof structures could either be kutcha  or pucca . \n18.7. In the other limb of submissions, the learned counsel has submitted \nthat the findings of fact by the Tribunal were set aside by the High Court in \nits writ jurisdiction without any cogent reason. The Tribun al had \ncategorically held that the structures on the land were kutcha  in nature, but \nthe High Court held that it was admitted that the structures were pucca in \nnature, without any discussion on this issue.  \nThe State  \n19. The learned counsel for the respondent -State has supported the \nsubmissions made on behalf of the appellants.  \n19.1. The learned counsel for the respondent -State has submitted  that \nthe order of the Controller is within the four corners of the law and is \nrequired to be upheld. The learned counsel would submit  that the definition \nof thika  tenant under Section 2(5) of the Act of 1949 was substituted by the \nWest Bengal Act VI of 19 53, which indicates that, from its inception, the \ndefinition of thika tenant clearly talked about \u201cany structure\u201d ; and there was 40 \n no scope to read  only kutcha  structure into the definition. It has been \nsubmitted that when words are clear and there is no amb iguity, there is no \nreason to resort to any external aid for interpretation. The learned counsel \nwould also submit that after insertion of Section 10A to the Act of 1949, \nthika tenants could erect pucca structures on the land with the permission \nof the Con troller and hence, the Act of 1949 did not contemplate a bar on \nerection of pucca structures by the thika tenant.  \n19.2. As regards the definition of \u201cany structure\u201d under the Act of 1981, it \nhas been submitted by the learned counsel that a provision for \u201ca ny \nstructure\u201d had been made in the Act of 1981, but the persons who were \nexcluded from the definition under the Act of 1949 were brought within the \nambit of the Act of 1981 ; and lands which were earlier excluded from the \ndefinition of  thika tenancy, were a lso brought within the ambit in the Act of \n1981 . The learned counsel has referred to the decision of this Court in \nRamdas Bansal (Dead) Through LR v. Kharag Singh Baid & Ors. : \n(2012) 2 SCC 548 . \n19.3. It has also been submitted that Section 6(4) of the Act of 1981 \npermitted a thika  tenant to construct pucca structures in accordance with \nthe building plans sanctioned under the Calcutta Municipal Corporation \nAct, 1980 or the Howrah Municipal Corporation A ct, 1980  but, the \nrequirement of prior permission from the Controller for erection of pucca \nstructures had not been provided for under the Act of 1981.  41 \n 19.4. It has been contended by the learned counsel for the State that the \nHigh Court, in Monmatha Nath M ukherjee (supra) , erred in concluding \nthat the Act of 1949 did not include pucca structures, since no external aid \nwas required for the purpose of interpreting the definition of thika tenant, \nand the Courts could  not have gone  behind the language of the stat ute, or \nadd or subtract from it. It has been submitted that the Courts cannot rewrite, \nrecast or reframe the legislation ; and reliance is placed on the decisions of", "(2012) 2 SCC 548 . \n19.3. It has also been submitted that Section 6(4) of the Act of 1981 \npermitted a thika  tenant to construct pucca structures in accordance with \nthe building plans sanctioned under the Calcutta Municipal Corporation \nAct, 1980 or the Howrah Municipal Corporation A ct, 1980  but, the \nrequirement of prior permission from the Controller for erection of pucca \nstructures had not been provided for under the Act of 1981.  41 \n 19.4. It has been contended by the learned counsel for the State that the \nHigh Court, in Monmatha Nath M ukherjee (supra) , erred in concluding \nthat the Act of 1949 did not include pucca structures, since no external aid \nwas required for the purpose of interpreting the definition of thika tenant, \nand the Courts could  not have gone  behind the language of the stat ute, or \nadd or subtract from it. It has been submitted that the Courts cannot rewrite, \nrecast or reframe the legislation ; and reliance is placed on the decisions of \nthis Court in Hardeep Singh v. State of Punjab & Ors. : (201 4) 3 SCC 92 \nand Afcons Infrastructure Ltd. & Anr. v. Cherian Varkey Construction \nCompany Private Limited  & Ors. : (2010) 8 SCC 24 . \n19.5. As regards the effect of repeal and re -enactment of Acts, it has \nbeen submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent -State that when \nan Act is repealed, it is treated as revoked or abrogated and removed from \nthe statute book. It has been argued with r eference to the decision  in Gajraj \nSingh & Ors. v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal & Ors. : (1997) 1 \nSCC 650 that whenever an Act is repealed, it must be considered as if it \nhad never existed, except when pertaining to past and closed transactions. \nThe l earned counsel would submit  that per Section 21 of the Act of 1981, \nthe Act of 1949 was completely repealed without a savings clause, and the \nAct of 1981 was given a special overriding effect by virtue of Section 4. The \nAct of 2001 further repealed the Act  of 1981, and came into force with effect \nfrom 01.03.2003, while being retrospectively applied with effect from \n18.01.1982. Since an overriding effect was provided while  repealing the 42 \n Act of 1949, any determination under the Act of 1949 required review in \nlight of the provisions of the repealing Act, being the Act of 1981 . By placing \nreliance on such overriding effect, it has been contended that the \nappellants became thika tenants by virtue of the operation of the Act of \n1981, with the subject property  having vested with the State from the date \nof commencement of the Act of 1981. It has  also been contended that the \nrespondent Nos. 1 and 2, who have stepped into the shoes of landlord, \nhave no right, title or interest in the property in question and hence, the  \nimpugned judgment is not sustainable in the eyes of the law.  \n19.6. It has additionally been submitted by the learned counsel that under \nthe Act of 1949, the two main factors to determine the claim of thika tenancy \nwere the nature of the structure on the l and and the length of the lease, but \nthese exclusions were not present in the Act of 2001 , which was also given \nan overriding effect in terms of Section 3 read with Section s 2(14) and 2(15) \nthere of. Hence, it has been submitted by the learned counsel that \ndisqualification under the Act of 1949 could not be used as a shield against \nthe application of the provisions of the Acts of 1981 and 2001, with the Act \nof 2001 being a complete and independent code in itself.  \n19.7. It has also been contended  that a decision taken on the basis of a \nprevious enactment is liable to be changed on the basis of existing \nenactment, and the status of thika tenancy is required to be examined \nafresh in light of the Act of 2001, irrespective of the status a tenant might  \nhave enjoyed under the previous enactments. Reliance is placed on the 43 \n decision of the High Court in the case of Ram Krishna Shaw v. Tachmani \nDevi : (1994) 1 CAL 394 . Hence, it has been the stand of  learned counsel \nfor the respondent -State that the register ed deed of lease dated \n15.12.1973 for a period of 20 years would not be a bar in considering the \nclaim  of thika tenancy.  \nThe respondent No. 1  \n20. Learned senior counsel for the respondent No. 1 has countered the \nsubmissions aforesaid and has supported the order impugned, again with \na variety of propositions.  \n20.1. In the first limb of submissions, the learned  senior  counsel has \ncontended that the a ppellants do not qualify as thika  tenants under the Act \nof 1949 and even  under  the Act of 1981.  \n20.2. As regards the status of the tenancy of the appellants under the Act \nof 1949, it has been submitted that leases beyond 12 years were excluded, \nand the ter m \u201cany structure\u201d has been interpreted to mean kutcha  structure \nin a series of decisions by the High Court of Calcutta. The term \u201cthika\u201d \nmeans \u201ctemporary\u201d or \u201cnon -permanent\u201d, and hence, only deals with \ntemporary tenancies.  \n20.3. The learned senior counsel for the respondent No. 1 has referred \nto the decision in Lakshmimoni Das  (supra) , where it was held that within \nthe scope and ambit of Act of 1981, only the lands comprised in thika  \ntenancies within meaning of Act of 1949, comprising kutcha  structure , or \npucca  structure constructed for residential purpose with permission of 44 \n Controller , or khatal  lands held under lease vested in the State;  and save \nas aforesaid , no other land and stru ctures vest ed under the said \nenactment.  The case of Sri Sri Satyanarayan (supra) has been  relied \nupon, where  it was observed  that thika  in Bengali meant temporary or \npartial . Reliance has also been placed on the decision in the case of \nKshiroda  Moyee Sen  (supra) , where it was held that a tenant was not \nentitled to put any permanent structure on the land under the Transfer of \nProperty Act or the Thika  Tenancy Act. Furthermore, b y placing reliance on \nMonmatha Nath Mukherjee (supra) , it is contended that nothing in the Act \nof 1949 entitled a tenant to erect a pucca  structure. It has also been pointed \nout that the decision in Monmatha Nath Mukherjee was affirmed by the \nDivision Bench of the High Court in Annapurna Seal v. Tincowri e Dutt \nand Anr. : 66 CWN 338 , wherein the High Court held that a pucca building \ncould not come under the purview of the Act of 1949, since it dealt with \nconcepts of temporary nat ures like the \u201c thika tenant\u201d, a \u201c bharatia\u201d  and \n\u201cstructures\u201d. It has also been submitted that the Statement of Objects and \nReasons of the Act of 1949 makes it clear that the Act was brought into \nforce to protect tenants having kutcha  or temporary structures from eviction \nand against  charging of exo rbitant amounts of rent by the landlord. The \nlearned counsel has also submitted that the term \u201cpucca structure\u201d was \nonly added for the first time in the Act of 2001.  \n20.4. As regards the Act of 1981, the learned senior counsel has argued  \nthat it was not th e intention of the legislature that land in all leases of vacant 45 \n land of any tenure upon which tenant constructed a structure would vest in \nState. By placing reliance on the Statement of Objects and Reasons, it is \nsubmitted that the Act of 1981 is an appro priatory and confiscatory \nenactment , which contemplated acquisition  and had not been for creation \nof thika  tenancies. Furthermore, it has been contended that even if one \nbecame a thika  tenant under the State, he would have to obtain permission \nto construct  pucca  structure in accordance with building plan sanctioned \nunder the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1980. Support has also been \nsought from the affirmation of the decision in  Monmatha Nath Mukherjee  \n(supra)  by the Division Bench in Jatadhari Daw & Grandsons (supra).  It \nhas been submitted by the learned counsel that some questions were \nreferred to the Full Bench of the High Court of Calcutta in Lakshmimoni \nDas (supra) , where it was held that per Section 5 of the Act of 1981, only \nthose lands which had kutcha  structures, or pucca  structures constructed \nwith permission of the Controller under the Act of 1949, and khatal  lands \nheld under a lease, would vest with the State under the Act  of 1981.  \n20.5. The learned counsel for the respondent No. 1 has submitted that \nthe decisions aforementioned have been consistently followed by the High \nCourt, even as recently as 2016 ; and a view which has been consistently \nadopted by the High Court for more than 60 years , deserves not to be upset \nat the instance of the appellants . Reliance is placed on the decision of this \nCourt in Shanker Raju v. Union of India : (2011 ) 2 SCC 132.  46 \n 20.6. The learned senior counsel has further submitted that repeal of the \nAct of 1949 and simul taneous re -enactment of the law, being the Act of \n1981, is an affirmation of the old law in the Act of 1949. Therefore, the Act \nof 1981 is required to be read in conjunction with the Act of 1949, as the \nlegislature was aware about the consistent judicial i nterpretation of the term \n\u201cany structure\u201d, but still did not change it. This shows the intent of the \nlegislature to keep the meaning of the term \u201cany structure\u201d in line with the \njudicial pronouncements and the Act of 1949. This definition was only \namended prospectively under the Act of 2001 by way of the Amendment \nAct of 2010. Reliance is placed on various  decisions of this Court including \nthose in Bengal Immunity Co mpany  Limited  v. State of Bihar  and Ors. : \n(1955 ) 2 SCR 603  and Gammon India Ltd. v. Special Chief Secretary & \nOrs.: (2006 ) 3 SCC 354 .  \n20.7. As regards the Amendment Act of 2010, inserting pucca structures \nin the term \u201cany structure\u201d, the learned counsel has submitted that this \namendment is prospective in nature, and not clarificatory, since the \namendment was made applicable from 01.11.2010, prospectively. The \nintention could  be ascertained from t he fact that when the Act of 1981 was", "legislature was aware about the consistent judicial i nterpretation of the term \n\u201cany structure\u201d, but still did not change it. This shows the intent of the \nlegislature to keep the meaning of the term \u201cany structure\u201d in line with the \njudicial pronouncements and the Act of 1949. This definition was only \namended prospectively under the Act of 2001 by way of the Amendment \nAct of 2010. Reliance is placed on various  decisions of this Court including \nthose in Bengal Immunity Co mpany  Limited  v. State of Bihar  and Ors. : \n(1955 ) 2 SCR 603  and Gammon India Ltd. v. Special Chief Secretary & \nOrs.: (2006 ) 3 SCC 354 .  \n20.7. As regards the Amendment Act of 2010, inserting pucca structures \nin the term \u201cany structure\u201d, the learned counsel has submitted that this \namendment is prospective in nature, and not clarificatory, since the \namendment was made applicable from 01.11.2010, prospectively. The \nintention could  be ascertained from t he fact that when the Act of 1981 was \nrepealed by the Act of 2001, some provisions of the Act of 2001 were \napplied retrospectively with effect from the date of commencement of the \nAct of 1981, i.e., 18.01.1982, while the Amendment Act of 2010 was \napplied p rospectively.  47 \n 20.8. It has also  been submitted by the learned counsel for the \nrespondent No. 1 that the appellants did not pay rent to the landlords after \nexpiry of the lease on 30.11.1993 and as such , their occupation after the \nexpiry of the lease is tena ncy at sufferance ; and a tenant at sufferance  is \nliable to pay mesne profits/damages, and not rent. Therefore, after \n30.11.1993, the appellants could not be thika  tenants, since they were not \nliable to pay rent. The learned counsel has referred to various decisions in \nthis regard  including that in Nand Ram  (Dead) Through Legal \nRepresentatives  v. Jagdish Prasad  (Dead) Through Legal \nRepresentatives : (2020 ) 9 SCC 393.   \n20.9. The learned senior counsel has also submitted that the operation \nof the Act of 1981 as regards the property in question was stayed by the \nHigh Court of Calcutta by the order dated 30.09.1983 in WP Civil Rule No. \n10449(W) of 1983. Therefore, the appellants could not be thika  tenants \nunder the Act of 19 81 and the said land could not vest with the State ; and \nsignificantly, the appellants filed Return in Form A on 10.04.2003 under the \nAct of 1981 when the said  Act had been repealed and additionally, the \nreturn filed was much after the expiry of lease.  \n20.10. In the last limb of arguments,  the learned senior counsel for the \nrespondent No. 1  has submitted that the findings of the High Court of \nCalcutta are correc t; that in rejoinder submissions, learned senior counsel \nfor the appellants had conceded that it was not appellants \u2019 case that any \nnew thika  tenancy was created under the Act of 1981 and since the 48 \n appellants were admittedly not thika  tenants under the Act of 1949, this part \nof submissions on behalf of the  appellant s clarifies that the y are not thika  \ntenants, and hence, the judgement of High Court deserves to be upheld.   \n21. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at sufficient \nlength and have  examined the record of the case with reference to the law \napplicable.  \nAnalysis  \n22. Having given anxious consideration to the entire matter, we are \nsatisfied  that the High Court has taken an eminently just and proper view \nof the matter in setting aside the untenable orders passed by the Controller \nand the Tribunal ; and  no case for interference is made out.   \n22.1 A long length of arguments  has been advanced before us by the \ncontesting parties, particularly in view of the peculiarities associated with \nthe three enactments and their amendments from time to time. Having \nregard to the subject matter, it appears appropriate only to deal with the \nmaterial propositions and factors while analysing the submissions. This \nanalysis could be broadly sub -divided into fo ur parts namely, the nature of \nthe structure in question; the statutory scheme and import of three \nenactments with their amendments; the relevant decisions; and other \nmiscellaneous but relevant factors.  \nThe Structure in question  \n23.  We may, in the first p lace, clear one of the unnecessary \nsubmissions made on behalf of the appellants as if the High Court has 49 \n unjustifiably stated that the structures in question were admittedly pucca in \nnature. This submission is unnecessary as also incorrect. The High Court \nhas made the relevant  observations about the nature of structure  and has  \nreturned its findings in that regard only after  proper comprehension of all \nthe relevant factual aspects.  \n23.1.  The fact that the structure  in question was pucca in nature could not \nhave been put to any issue by the appellants. As noticed, the learned \nController, in paragraph 3 of his findings in the order dated 01.08.2012, \ncategorically recorded the facts that even from the assessment register of \nthe Corporation, it was clearly s hown that at all material times, there were \nplaced such structures at the subject property which fell within the meaning \nof \u201cpucca structures\u201d. The Controller also found with reference to the \nenquiry report that there were structures having pucca foundatio n, pucca \nfloors and pucca walls as also brick walls with tin shed. The Tribunal, in its \nfindings, made rather strange observations that the structure in question \nwas a \u201csemi -pucca \u201d one and for that purpose, referred only to tin shed and \nnot the other struc tures as noticed and mentioned by the Controller. In fact, \nthe Tribunal diverted its attention more to its proposition that after the \nAmendment Act of 1993, all types of structures were included within the \nmeaning of \u201cany structure\u201d. In any case, the Tribu nal also could not return \na specific finding that it had been a kutcha structure. The classification of \nsemi -pucca , as attempted to be carved out by the Tribunal, was neither 50 \n envisaged by the statute nor could have been countenanced in view of the \nspecific  facts noticed by the Controller.  \n23.2.  The High Court has, obviously, taken into comprehension the \nfindings of the Controller which were never challenged by the appellants \nand hence, made the observations that the lessee s had admittedly raised \npucca structure. Even if the appellants seek to dispute such findings, such \na dispute is required to be rejected, particularly with reference to \nindisputable findings of the Controller. The structure in question had been \na pucca structure. Its implication shall unfo ld hereafter.   \nThe statutory scheme and the import of three enactment with their \namendments  \n24. A quick but comprehensive recap of the entire environment \nsurrounding the enactments in question would make it clear that by the Act \nof 1949, essentially the thika tenancies were sought to be regulated, more \nparticularly against arbitrary eviction and enhancement of rent. Therein, by \nthe Amendment Act No. XXIX of 1969, the thika tenant was given the right \nto erect pucca structure in case the land comprised in t he holding was \nbeing used for residential purposes, of course, with previous permission of \nthe Controller. Bharatias , being essentially the persons paying rent in \nrespect of the structure erected by the thika tenant, were also given \nprotection so that thika tenant would not eject them for erecting a pucca \nstructure. The legislature duly took note of  the requirements of giving \nprotection to thika tenants and bharatias against ejectment and thus, the \nCalcutta Thika Tenancy Stay of Proceedings (Temporary Provi sions) Act, 51 \n 1978, was enacted , whose life was extended upto 18.07.1981. As specified \nin the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the Act of 1981, the object of \nthe said Act of 1978 was to provide temporary protection against ejectment \nuntil a comprehensive  legislation was enacted to deal with the public \ngrievances.  \n24.1.  The various features of the Act of 1949 had been the subject -matter \nof debates in various decisions of Calcutta High Court, particularly after \namendment in the year 1953 in the definition of thika tenant . One of the \nconsistent lines of thought remained in various decisions like those in the \ncase of Kshiroda  Moyee Sen , Monmatha Nath Mukherjee  and \nAnnapurna Seal  (supra), that the expression \u201cany structure\u201d , as referred \nto in Section 2(5) though ordinarily could be  interpreted as \u201call structures\u201d \nbut, while harmonising the said provision with Section 108(p) of the \nTransfer of Property Act, the term \u201c structure \u201d in this definition could refer  \nonly to  a \u201ckutcha structure \u201d.  \n25. Then, i n the Act of 1981, the State Legislature introduced the \nprovisions for acquisition of the rights of landlords in the land comprised in \nthika tenancies by payment of certain amount on the lines of the then \noperating Urban Land Ceiling (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976. This \nacquisition was to result in vesting of all the righ ts in the land comprised in \nthika tenancies in the State free from all encumbrances; and the thika \ntenants were to hold the land under the State on prescribed terms and \nconditions. Protection against ejectment was also granted to bharatias .  52 \n 25.1.  Again, t he salient features of the Act of 1981, as originally enacted, \nhad been the subject -matter of several debates in the High Court with same \nconsistent line of thought that the \u201cstructure\u201d referred to in the definition of \n\u201cthika tenant\u201d  meant only kutcha structure ; and it related to pucca structure \nonly when the same was for residential purposes.  \n25.2.  In the Act of 1981, t he legislat ive intent, on one hand being of \nprotecting the interest of vulnerable class of tenants/occupants but on the \nother hand , the fiat being of exaction of the landlord\u2019s property to the State, \nobviously, the provisions were required to be construed in a balanced", "acquisition was to result in vesting of all the righ ts in the land comprised in \nthika tenancies in the State free from all encumbrances; and the thika \ntenants were to hold the land under the State on prescribed terms and \nconditions. Protection against ejectment was also granted to bharatias .  52 \n 25.1.  Again, t he salient features of the Act of 1981, as originally enacted, \nhad been the subject -matter of several debates in the High Court with same \nconsistent line of thought that the \u201cstructure\u201d referred to in the definition of \n\u201cthika tenant\u201d  meant only kutcha structure ; and it related to pucca structure \nonly when the same was for residential purposes.  \n25.2.  In the Act of 1981, t he legislat ive intent, on one hand being of \nprotecting the interest of vulnerable class of tenants/occupants but on the \nother hand , the fiat being of exaction of the landlord\u2019s property to the State, \nobviously, the provisions were required to be construed in a balanced \nmanner and were so construed by the Calcutta High Court in several of its \ndecisions and the matter was ultimately dealt with by the Full Bench of the  \nHigh Court in the case of Lakshmimoni Das  (supra) wherein, the Full \nBench approved the interpretation of Section 5 of the Act as put by the \nDivision Bench in the case of Jatadhari Daw  & Grandsons  (supra). The \nFull Bench answered the reference in the following terms: - \n\u201c56. For the reasons aforesai d we hold as follows: \u2014 \n(a) The impugned Act is not protected under Art. 31C of the \nConstitution as it is  found on scrutiny of different provisions of the \nimpugned Act  that the impugned Act has not been enacted to give \neffect to provisions of Arts. 39(b) an d (c) of the Constitution and the \nimpugned Act is  open to challenge  on the score of violations of Part \nIII of the Constitution.  \n \n(b) Within the scope and ambit of S. 5 of the impugned Act only \nlands comprised in thika tenancies within the meaning of the \nCalcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 comprising a kutcha structure \nand/or a pucca structure constructed for residential purpose with th e \npermission of the Controller under the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, \n1949 and khatal lands held under a lease shall vest and save as \naforesaid no other land and structure vest under the impugned Act.  \n 53 \n (c) Sub -sections (2) and (3) of S. 8 of the impugned Ac t and R. 5, \nCalcutta Thika  Tenancy (Acquisition and Regulation) Rules, 1982 \nare ultra vires the  Constitution.  \n \n(d) Rule 3(b) of the Calcutta Thika Tenancy (Acquisition and \nRegulation) Rules,  1982 excepting the following portion \u201cevery thika \ntenant or tenan t shall pay to  the Controller annual revenue being \nnot less than what he was paying to the  landlord before the coming \ninto force of the Act\u201d Rules 3(h), 3(i) and 3(j) of the  said rules are \nultra vires.  \n \n(e) Section 19 of the impugned Act in so far as it pu rports to abate \nany pending  appeal preferred by a thika tenant against a decree for \neviction of thika tenant  under the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 \nand any execution proceeding for  eviction of a thika tenant against \nwhom a decree for eviction had been passed  under the Calcutta \nThika Tenancy Act, 1949 before the enforcement of the  impugned \nAct is illegal and ultra vires.  \n \n(f) Section 6(2) of the impugned Act excepting the proviso \nthereunder and Ss. 26  and 27 of the impugned Act are declared \nultra vires. \u201d \n25.3.  We are essentially concerned with the sub -paragraph (b) aforesaid \nas regards the construction of Section 5 of the Act of 1981. Interestingly, \nwhile the said decision in Lakshmimoni Das  (supra) was challenged in \nthis Court but, even during the penden cy of such challenge, the legislature \nmade amendments to the Act of 1981 by virtue of the Amendment Act of \n1993 which was intended to remove the practical difficulties in operation of \nthe Act of 1981. By this Amendment, even the Title and the Preamble of \nthe Act of 1981 as originally enacted were amended. In fact, such \namendment of title etc. had its foundation in the observations occurring in \nLakshmimoni Das  (supra) wherein the Full Bench of the High Court, inter \nalia, took into consideration the original title of the enactment, i.e., the \nCalcutta Thika  Tenancy (Acquisition and Regulation) Act, 1981 while \nconstruing its provisions where the expression \u201cother land\u201d was not there.  54 \n 25.4.  However, it could be readily seen that the amendment of Section 5 \nby the Amendment Act of 1993, rather than removing the difficulties and \nclarifying the position of law as also rather than removing the basis of the \ndecision in Lakshmimoni Das  (supra), only  created more complexities and \nunworkable situation where  the effect of newly inserted  clause (c) of \nSection 5 was going to be as if any land given on lease in any manner was \nto result in vesting of the interest of the landlord in the State. If we could \nsay so, the shortcomings in the originally enacted Section 5 of the Act of \n1981,  which were indicated in Lakshmimoni Das  (supra) by the Full Bench \nof the Calcutta High Court, rather than being removed, became more \nprominent  with complexities because of the A mendment Act of 1993.   \n25.5.  In our view, the High Court has rightly held  in the order impugned  \nthat the confusions and anomalies were dealt with in the Act of 2001; and \nbecause of the larger part of absurdity having been removed in the Act of \n2001, the challenge  in this Court to the judgment in  Lakshmimoni Das  \nwas not taken forward.  \n26. The object and purpose of these enactments  and text of the \nrelevant provisions, when examined with reference to their texture and \ncontext, the provisions of vesting as evolved by way of originally enacted \nSection 5 of the Act of 1981 and as provided for in Section 4 of the Act of \n2001 read with the Am endment Act of 2010 put  it beyond the pale of doubt \nthat until the advent of the Amendment Act of 2010 w.e.f. 01.11.2010, \nerection of pucca structure on the leased land did not bring the tenant within 55 \n the definition of thika tenant and thus, there could no t have been any \nvesting in the State under Section 5 of the Act of 1981 (whether originally \nenacted or amended) or under Section 4 of the Act of 2001, as originally \nenacted.  \n27. We may also observe that ordinarily, a later enactment may not be a \nsafe exte rnal aid for interpreting the preceding enactment on the same \nsubject but the object and purport of the enactments dealing with thika \ntenancies commencing from the year 1949 and continuing with successive \nenactments of 1981, its amendment in 1993, then the  enactment of 2001 and \nits amendment in the year 2010, formed a series of legislative exercises \ntowards the same subject, i.e., protection of thika tenants . Hence,  the later \npromulgation  of the Act of 2001  and its  amendments could have been \nreferred to , and have  rightly been referred to , by the High Court in the \nimpugned judgment  while construing the Act of 1981 .  \n27.1.  There are other  strong reason s for which  too, the successor \nenactment  is required to be taken in aid for construing the provisions of the \npreceding enactment in the present case . It is a fact that even when the Act \nof 2001 came into force from 01.03.2003, the vesting of the land comprised \nin thika tenancies and other land e tc. was deemed to have occurred w.e.f. \n18.01.1982; that being the very date of enforcement of the Act of 1981.  \nLearned counsel for the respondent No. 1  appears right in his submissions \nthat the Act of 1981  having been simultaneously enacted while repealing  the \nAct of 1949, it had to be read in conjunction with the preceding enactment 56 \n and the legislature would be deemed to be aware of the judicial \npronouncements as regards the material terms of the Act of 1949 which were, \nwith same frame and phraseology, retained  in the new enactment.  The \ndecisions referred to by the learned counsel for the respondent No. 1 in the \ncases of Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. and Gammon India Ltd.  (supra) \nprovide enough guide on the principle that repeal and simultaneous re -\nenactment is  to be considered as reaffirmation of the old law. The submission \non behalf of the appellants and the State , that the interpretations put to the \nexpression \u201cany structure\u201d , as occurring in relation to the Act of 1949 , cannot \nbe imported for the purpose of the interpretation of the same expression in \nsimilar enactment with similar phraseology, which was made in replacement \nof the earlier one , is required to be rejected . The exclusion aspects of the Act \nof 1949 had , of course , not been continued in the Act of 1981 but the basic \nelements for a tenancy to become thika tenancy remained the same namely, \nrequirement of payment of rent and construction/acquisition of any structure \nthereat by the tenant.  There is nothing in the Act of 1981 for which the \ninterpretation of the expression \u201cany structure\u201d could have been made \ndifferent than the interpretation  of the same expression in regard to the Act \nof 1949 . \n28. The suggestion that the expression \u201cany structure\u201d, in its plain \nmeaning ought to be construed as inclusive of all structures whether kutcha  \nor pucca , needs to be rejected for a variety of reasons.  57 \n 28.1.   In the Act of 1949 as originally enacted, even though  the \nexpress ion \u201cany structure\u201d had been used but, it was consistently \nmaintained by the Calcutta High Court with reference to the object and \npurpose of Act  of 1949 and its frame  that, the definition of \u201cthika tenant \u201d \nwould not include pucca  structure because the enactment was otherwise \nnot dealing with the rights and liabilities of the tenant, for which the \nprovisions of Transfer of Property Act were required to be referred to; and \nsuch a proposition was also in accord with Section 2(6) of t he Act of 1949; \nand per Section 108(p) of the Transfer of Property Act, a pucca  structure", "different than the interpretation  of the same expression in regard to the Act \nof 1949 . \n28. The suggestion that the expression \u201cany structure\u201d, in its plain \nmeaning ought to be construed as inclusive of all structures whether kutcha  \nor pucca , needs to be rejected for a variety of reasons.  57 \n 28.1.   In the Act of 1949 as originally enacted, even though  the \nexpress ion \u201cany structure\u201d had been used but, it was consistently \nmaintained by the Calcutta High Court with reference to the object and \npurpose of Act  of 1949 and its frame  that, the definition of \u201cthika tenant \u201d \nwould not include pucca  structure because the enactment was otherwise \nnot dealing with the rights and liabilities of the tenant, for which the \nprovisions of Transfer of Property Act were required to be referred to; and \nsuch a proposition was also in accord with Section 2(6) of t he Act of 1949; \nand per Section 108(p) of the Transfer of Property Act, a pucca  structure \nwas not permissible.  In Jatadhari Daw & Grandsons (supra) , the Division \nBench of the High Court, even while construing the Act of 1981, proceeded \non the same lines a nd held that the expression \u201cstructure\u201d in the statute did \nnot include permanent structure.   \n28.2.  The Full Bench of the High Court in Lakshmimon i Das (supra) \nmeticulously examined variegated aspects  of the matter and various \nprovisions of enactments  and also different pronouncements while holding \nthat construction of kutcha  structure on the lease hold land was a sine qua \nnon for constituting thika  tenancy.  We find such interpretation to be in \naccord with the very object and purpose of these enactments , at least until \nthe enforcement of the Amendment Act of  2010 w.e.f. 01.11.2010 ; and the \nsubmission of learned counsel for the respondent No. 1 based  on the \ndoctrine of stare decisis  deserves to be accepted that the interpretation of \nthis particular term \u201cany structure\u201d, which has been holding field for more 58 \n than half a century ought not to be disturbed or unsettled.  In Shanker Raju  \n(supra) this Court  had held that: - \n \u201c10. It is a settled principle of law that a judgment, which has held \nthe field for a long time, should not be unsettled. The doctrine of \nstare decisis is expressed in the maxim stare decisis et non quieta \nmovere , which means \u201cto stand b y decisions and not to disturb what \nis settled\u201d. Lord Coke aptly described this in his classic English \nversion as \u201c those things which have been so often adjudged ought \nto rest in peace \u201d. The underlying logic of this doctrine is to maintain \nconsistency and avoid uncertainty. The guiding philosophy is that a \nview which has held the field for a long time should not be disturbed \nonly because another view is possible\u2026.\u201d  \n28.3. There are several indications which unfailingly lead to the \nconclusion that \u201cany structure\u201d which was employed in the Act of 1949 and \nwas further employed in the Act of 1981 and also in the Act of 2001 for the \npurpose of creation of thika  tenancy referred only to kutcha  structure  until \nthe year 2010 . The first and foremost in dication comes from the \namendment of the Act of 1949 by Act of XX IX of 1969 whereby clause (4a) \nwas inserted to Section 2 and then Section 10A was inserted to the \nenactment which, in effect, invested a right in the thika  tenant to erect a \npucca  structure w hen using the land in question for a residential purpose \nbut only with permission of the Controller.  If pucca  structure was a part of \nthe definition of thika  tenant in clause (5) of Section 2, Section 10A was \nnever required to be inserted to the Act of 1949 . Then, in the Act of 1981, \neven when the legislature provided for acquisition of land comprised in \nthika  tenancy and other lands, the principal part of the  definition of thika  \ntenant remained the same ; only the other three exclusion conditions,  as \noccurring in clause (5) of Section 2 of the Act of 1949 were removed.  59 \n However, the Act of 1981 , as originally enacted, never provided for creation \nof thika  tenancy  by the event of tenant erecting or acquiring by purchase \nor gift, any pucca  structure.  \n28.4. Of course, by amendment of Section 5 by the Amendment Act of \n1993, it was introduced that even \u201cother land\u201d under lease could be \nacquired but, the purpose and obj ect of the enactment did not provide for \nsuch a broad and all -pervading legislative fiat. This aspect of the matter \ndoes not require any further elaboration in the present case for the \nfundamental reason that claim of the appellant s had only been of thika  \ntenancy and when they do not answer to the description of thika  tenant, \nthere would arise no question of operation of Section 5 of the Act of 1981 , \nwhether in i ts unamended form or in its amended form.  \n28.5. Significant it is to no tice that even in the Act of 2001, as originally \nenacted, the definition of thika  tenancy in clause (14) of Section 2 thereof \nretained more or less the same expression s as were  there  in the Act of 1981 ; \nand the expression \u201cany structure including pucca  structure\u201d came to be \ninserted to this clause only by the Amendment Act of 2010.  Moreover, the \nAmendment Act of 2010 was given only prospective effect from 01.11.2010 \nand not the retrospective effect, as was earlier given to the original Section 4 \nof the Act of 2001. Thus, acquisition of the land comprising thika  tenancy with \neven erection or acquisition of pucca  structure by the thika  tenant came to be \nprovided for in specific terms by the legislature only from 01.11.2010 and not \nbefore. As noticed, befo re 01.11.2010, so far as the lease in question was 60 \n concerned, the same had ceased to subsist and there was no existing lease \nwhich could have taken the appellants within the frame of thika  tenancy on \n01.11.2010.  \nThe relevant decisions of Calcutta High Court  \n29. Though a large number of decisions concerning the three enactments \nin question, more particularly in relation to thika tenancy and the implication \nof structure on the demised property , have been cited but instead of  \nelongating this discussion with multiple authorities, it appears appropriate to \ntake note of the considerations of the Full Bench of Calcutta High Court in \nthe case of Lakshmimoni Das (supra) wherein the Court dealt with the \nprovisions of the Act of 1981 as originally enacted. Therein, the Full Bench \nexpressed its relevant reasoning and ratio , inter alia , in the following terms: -  \n\u201c43. Keeping in mind of the principle of interpretation indicated \nhereinabove, an attempt should be  made to ascertain what was  the \nmischief sought to be remedied by the impugned legislation. If the \ninterpretation put forth by Mr. Gupta, the learned Additional \nAdvocate General appearing for the State Respondents is accepted \nin toto, it appears to us that the same would undoubtedly  produce \npalpable injustice, anomaly, contradiction and lead to absurd results \nand in order to avoid such peculiar situation, a reasonable meaning \nto those words should be given which does not cause any ambiguity \nand/or absurdity and the mischief sought to  be remedied is also \nproperly achieved. In this connection, the title of the impugned Act \nmay supply some guidance to the construction of S . 5 of the \nimpugned Act. Although, the title does not override the plain \nmeaning of the section but in case of ambigu ity and doubt, the title \nserves as a good guideline. The title of the impugned Act only refers \nto acquisition and regulation of thika tenancy (by repealing the \nCalcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949). Looking into the history of the \nlegislation and purpose of th e legislation, it appears to us that the \nimpugned legislation is plainly to abolish the rights of the landlord \nover the lands held by thika tenants which were so long governed \nby the provisions of Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949. The \npassage quoted from C ooley's 'A Treatise on the Constitutional \nLimitations' at pages 143 and 149 since referred to by Mr. Pal \nappearing for same of the petitioners may not be wholly applicable 61 \n while construing a provision of statute in our country. The legislation \nin our count ry is not bound by the title to an Act strictly and the \nlegislature can travel beyond the title but at the same time \nConstitution makers did not intend that the legislature will pass an \naltogether different Act under the cover of a title thereby misleading  \nthe legislators themselves and also the authority requiring to give \nassent to the legislation. In our view, it should be the endeavour  for \nthe Court to strike a balance by giving a meaning which has \nconnection with the title of the Act and the intention of the legislature \nand the evil sought to be remedied. At the same time, the Court has \nto interpret the Act in such a manner so that it may not lead to any \ndestructive result and/or absurd or inconsistent situation. In our \nview, while interpreting the words \"other lands\" after the words 'thika \ntenancy' the legal maxim ejusdem generis (of the same kind) and \nthe maxim 'noscitur a sociis' (a thing is known by its companion) \nshould be borne in mind.  \nApplying these legal maxims, it appears to us that 'other land' \nappearing in S. 5 of the impugned Act must mean land falling under \nthe category of thika tenancy land. This general word following a \nspecific word must apply not to different objects of a widely differing \ncharacter, but something which can be called a class or kind of \nobjects. In this case, from the title, preamble of the Act, the intention \nof the legislature as also on consideration of the mischief sought to \nbe remedied by the impugned Act it must be held that 'other land' \nmust be land coming within the category of thika tenancy land. If \nhowever appears that besides the lands comprising thika tenancies \nlands used as khatals and the right , title and interest of landlord in", "view, while interpreting the words \"other lands\" after the words 'thika \ntenancy' the legal maxim ejusdem generis (of the same kind) and \nthe maxim 'noscitur a sociis' (a thing is known by its companion) \nshould be borne in mind.  \nApplying these legal maxims, it appears to us that 'other land' \nappearing in S. 5 of the impugned Act must mean land falling under \nthe category of thika tenancy land. This general word following a \nspecific word must apply not to different objects of a widely differing \ncharacter, but something which can be called a class or kind of \nobjects. In this case, from the title, preamble of the Act, the intention \nof the legislature as also on consideration of the mischief sought to \nbe remedied by the impugned Act it must be held that 'other land' \nmust be land coming within the category of thika tenancy land. If \nhowever appears that besides the lands comprising thika tenancies \nlands used as khatals and the right , title and interest of landlord in \nsuch khatals are intended to be vested under S. 5. Lands \ncomprising pucca and permanent structures erected by the tenant \nfor user of the land for khatals and lands used for khatals held under \na lease for a period beyond twelve years cannot comprise thika \ntenancy within the meaning of 'thika tenancy' under the Calcutta \nThika Tenancy Act. It also appears to us that the expression 'thika \ntenancy' under the aforesaid Act has been judicially noted in various \ndecisions of this court as referred to by Mr. Pal and it must be \naccepted that the Legislature is aware of the meaning of such \nexpression and has, therefore, used the expression on the basis of \nthe said accepted meaning. But it appears to us that S. 5 expressly \nenvisages ve sting of khatals although all khatals may not conform \nto 'thika tenancy' within the meaning of thika tenancy under the \nCalcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 which is repealed by the \nimpugned Act. In view of express reference of khatal without any \nreservation in  S. 5, we are inclined to hold that although the \nimpugned act is essentially a piece of legislation for vesting of thika \ntenancy lands and temporary or kutcha structures thereon and for \nregulation of such lands and structures and the title of the Act and \nthe provision for repealing the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 \nalso conform to such intention and purpose of the impugned \nlegislation, khatal lands held on lease even if such lands do not \ncomprise thika tenancy within the meaning of thika tenancy under 62 \n the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act also vest under S. 5. It appears to \nus that most of the khatals comprise kutcha or temporary structure \nand they also comprise thika tenancies within the meaning of 'thika \ntenancy' under the said 1949 Act. We may also take judic ial notice \nthat in majority cases, thika tenancies comprise bustees and/or \nslums and the legislature has intended to vest thika tenancies and \nstructures thereon for regulating such thika tenancy lands. It \ntherefore appears to us that with an intention to r egulate khatal \nlands, along with other underdeveloped lands and structures mainly \ncomprising bustees or slums, the legislature has expressly included \nkhatals in S. 5 for the purpose of vesting of such khatals and \nconsequential control and regulation of kha tals. We therefore \napprove the interpretation of S. 5 of the impugned Act as made in \nthe Bench decision of this Court in Jatadhari Daw's case, Appeal \nNo. 239 of 1978 reported in (1986) 1 Cal HN 21. Save as aforesaid, \nno other land or structure vest under t he impugned Act. \u201d \n29.1.  In the passing, we may also observe that the suggestions made on \nbehalf of the appellants and the State that the decision of Jatadhari Daw & \nGrandsons  (supra) has been set aside by this Court by its order dated \n27.10.2004 is not cor rect as such . By the said order dated 27.10.2004, the \nmatters were remitted to the High Court,  particularly in view of subsequent \nlegislations in the form of Amendment Act of 1993 as also the Act of 2001 , \nwithout this Court having pronounced on the questio n of law either way. \nSimilarly, the decision in Lakshmimoni Das (supra) has also not been \nexamined on its ratio and merits by this Court earlier.  \n30. Apart that we have no hesitation in giving our imprimatur to the \nenunciation aforesaid, we are also at one  with the observations of the High \nCourt in the impugned order that even after amendment of the Act of 1981 \nby the Amendment Act of 1993 , vesting indiscriminately of every  parcel of let \nout land, in the broad expression \u201cother land\u201d , could not have been  bought \nabout and hence , ultimately this enactment , as such , was given up and was \nsubstituted by the Act of 2001.   63 \n Other miscellaneous but relevant factors  \n31. Apart from the aforesaid view taken b y us, so far as the present \nmatter is concerned, a fundamental reason  operates against the \napplicability of the Act of 1981. As noticed,  after coming into force of the \nAct of 1981, the same was indeed challenged by the landlord in the High \nCourt and indisp utably, operation of the enactment qua the subject \nproperty was stayed by the High Court. The correctness or otherwise of the \norder so passed by the High Court is not a matter of question before us. \nThe fact of the matter remains that the said Act was unde r total eclipse qua \nthe subject property pursuant to the binding order of the High Court. \nTherefore, any suggestion about the operation of the said enactment and \nthereby vesting of the subject property in the State pursuant to Section 5 \nof the Act of 1981 is rather redundant.  \n32. Then, the lease in question came to an end on 30.11.1993. \nThereafter, the appellants ceased to be persons liable to pay rent at \nmonthly or in any other periodical rate. In that position, they ceased to \nanswer to the definition of thika tenant within the meaning of Section 3(8) \nof the Act of 1981. Similarly, they did not answer to the description of thika \ntenant within the meaning of Section 2(14) of the Act of 2001. As a \nnecessary corollary, neither Section 5 of the Act of 1981 app lied to the \ntenancy in question nor Section 4 of the Act of 2001. The application made \nbefore the Controller in the month of April, 2003 for accepting the 64 \n appellants and/or their predecessors as thika  tenants was, therefore, \nfundamentally misconceived and could have only been rejected.  \n33. It is also significant to notice that the Controller, in his detailed order \ndated 01.08.2012, even after examining all the fact s of the case and also \nthe provisions of law applicable, repeatedly held that the appellants could \nnot have been treated as thika  tenants under the Act of 1949 or under the \nAct of 1981. It was only in the last part of the impugned order dated \n01.08.2012, the learned Controller abruptly picked up the decision in \nPurushottam Das Murarka  (supra)  and held on that basis that since \nconstruction of pucca  structure was not prohibited, therefore, the applicants  \ncould be taken as thika  tenants.  Such a proposition was not compatible \nwith the findings in the earlier part of the same order and with the statute \nas also  with the purport and effect of the decision in Purushottam Das \nMurarka .  \n33.1.  In the case of Purushottam Das Murarka  (supra) , the two major \nquestions ha d been about the period of lease with reference to the initial \nperiod of five years and renewal of seven years; and about the effect of \nthika  tenant  constructing or attempt ing to construct pucca  structure on the \ndemised land . The  period of tenancy is not re levant for  the present \npurpose . As regards the aspect relating to the structure , the Court noticed \nthe decision s in Monmatha Nath Mukherjee  and Annapurna Seal  (supra) \nbut then , observed that if during pendency of lease , a thika  tenant \nconstructs or attempts to construct pucca  structure on demised land 65 \n without permission of landlord, he does not cease to be  the thika  tenant. \nThus, t he lessee being a thika  tenant was an existing  fact in said case. The \nHigh Court  has rightly observed that it was never held in Purushottam Das \nMurarka  (supra)  that if tenant of a land would raise  pucca  structure, he \nwould  automatically become  a thika  tenant.  The conclusion drawn on the \nbasis of the said decision by the Controller could have only been  \ndisapproved.  \n33.2.  Then, t he Tribunal, in its impugned order, attempted to inject \nvarious such philosophies which were simply beside the point.  In our view, \nthe High Court has meticulously examined the matter in its right perspective \nand, with apt analysis of all the three enactme nts vis -\u00e0-vis the facts of the \ncase, has rightly concluded against the claim of the thika  tenancy of the \nappellants  and/or their predecessors . \n34.  In the aforesaid view of the matter, we do not consider it necessary \nto enter into any further or finer analysis of other contentions urged and \ndecisions cited by the learned counsel for the respective parties.  In our \nview, the impugned order deserves to be upheld because neither the \nappellants became thika  tenants under  the enactments aforesaid  nor there \nhad been any vesting of the subject property  thereunder .   \nConclusion  \n35. In summation of what has been discussed hereinabove, we could \nbroadly say:  66 \n 1. The Full Bench decision of Calcutta High Court in Lakshmimoni \nDas (supra) is affirmed.  \n2. The structure, as put up by the appellants and/or their \npredecessors, had been pucca  structure on the property  in question.  \n3. For the structure being pucca  in chara cter and the term of lease \nbeing 20 years, the appellants and/or their predecessors were not \nthika tenants within the meaning of Section 2(5) of the Act of 1949.  \n4. The appellants and/or their predecessors were not thika tenants \nwithin the meaning of the A ct of 1981 for two major reasons:  \n a. that the structure in question was a pucca  structure ; and", "view, the impugned order deserves to be upheld because neither the \nappellants became thika  tenants under  the enactments aforesaid  nor there \nhad been any vesting of the subject property  thereunder .   \nConclusion  \n35. In summation of what has been discussed hereinabove, we could \nbroadly say:  66 \n 1. The Full Bench decision of Calcutta High Court in Lakshmimoni \nDas (supra) is affirmed.  \n2. The structure, as put up by the appellants and/or their \npredecessors, had been pucca  structure on the property  in question.  \n3. For the structure being pucca  in chara cter and the term of lease \nbeing 20 years, the appellants and/or their predecessors were not \nthika tenants within the meaning of Section 2(5) of the Act of 1949.  \n4. The appellants and/or their predecessors were not thika tenants \nwithin the meaning of the A ct of 1981 for two major reasons:  \n a. that the structure in question was a pucca  structure ; and  \n b. that t he Act of 1981 was not operative in relation to the property \nin question because of the stay order passed by the High Court.  \n5. On the date when lease  expired in the month of November, 1993, \nthe appellants and/or their predecessors were not thika tenants and , \ntherefore, the Act of 2001 does not enure to their benefit.  \n6. The impugned decision of the High Court, therefore, calls for no \ninterference.  \n36. Before closing, we may also take note of the fact that by way of \ninterim orders dated 15.04.2014 and 22.07.2014, the appellants were \ndirected to make payment towards  occupa ncy charges. The appellants \nhave made certain deposits and by the order dated 27.08.2021 , we had \ndirected the appellants to deposit further  an amount of Rs. 20 ,00,000/ - \n(Rupees twenty lakhs) in the Registry of this Court of which , the contesting 67 \n respondent s were held entitle d to withdraw an amount of Rs. 16,50,000/ - \n(Rupees sixteen  lakhs  fifty thousand ) by way of the occupancy charges; \nand the remaining amount was ordered to be invested in a fixed deposit \nwith periodical renewal, to be disbursed subject to the outcome of this \nappeal. The said deposited amount  together with accrued interest  is \nordered to be disbursed to the respondent No. 1 while we otherwise leave \nit open for the said respondent in taking recourse to appropriate remedies, \nstrictly in accordance with law , in relation to any other claim/relief.  \n37. Accordingly  and in view of the above, this appeal fails and is, \ntherefore, dismissed  subject to the observations foregoing . All pending \napplications also stand disposed of. No order as to costs.  \n \n\u2026\u2026....\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.J.  \n(A.M.
